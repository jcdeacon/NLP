make
a
pact
,
right
after
`
patch
adam
'
,
to
not
be
easili
be
sucker
by
movi
drip
with
sentiment
.

but
darn
it
,
`
music
of
the
heart
'
is
just
layer
with
feel-good
materi
and
bright
character
.

it
's
hard
to
dislik
a
movi
that
us
such
skill
with
it
's
manipul
.

in
addit
,
it
's
also
a
terrif
famili
film
.

thi
is
the
true
stori
of
violin
teacher
roberta
guaspari
,
who
fought
the
school
board
to
keep
the
music
program
activ
in
a
hand
of
inner
citi
harlem
school
.

it
could
also
be
describ
as
`
mr.
streep
's
opu
'
.

ye
,
meryl
streep
bring
her
dramat
clout
to
the
demand
role
of
guaspari
,
and
that
bring
both
good
new
and
bad
.

out
of
the
gate
,
possibl
becaus
of
her
distract
star
power
and
the
rush
write
,
it
is
rel
difficult
to
identifi
with
roberta
's
charact
and
grasp
her
academ
point-of-view
.

she
is
veri
strict
with
her
student
,
but
what
insight
doe
that
creat
into
the
stori
?

slowli
but
sure
,
we
begin
to
recogn
the
intent
of
the
charact
,
and
show
admir
for
the
thought
and
human
feel
that
streep
ha
onc
again
appli
.

on
thoroughli
interest
fact
about
`
music
of
the

'
li
with
the
unlik
presenc
in
the

chair

horror
veteran
we
craven

after
leav
an
impress
with
the
`
scream
'
film
and
the
origin
`
nightmar
on
elm
street
'
,
craven
ha
attempt
a
precari
cross-over
to
drama
.

at
first
,
hi
inexperi
with
the
genr
is
fairli
obviou
,
but
as
the
film
progress
craven
find
a
surprisingli
comfort
nich
with
direct
thi
materi
.

it
doe
n't
carri
the
heart-warm
courag
of
`
mr.
holland
's
opu
'
,
but
`
music
of
the
heart
'
is
casual
assur
and
fill
with
littl
morsel
of
dramat
truth
.

the
tag
team
of
streep
and
craven
work
better
than
you
would
anticip
.

ye
,
oscar
could
come
call
onc
again
for
meryl
streep
,
but
it
's
the
solid
ensembl
cast
that
make
`

work
.

's
like

in

the
