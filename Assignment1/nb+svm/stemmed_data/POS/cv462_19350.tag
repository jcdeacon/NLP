thi
is
an
interest
film
.

i
must
first
off
state
,
that
you
mu
n't
believ
ani
of
the
rumor
of
the
film
.

cruis
is
not
a
cross
dresser
,
kidman
doe
n't
shoot
heroin
,
and
there
's
not
ani
scene
between
the
two
that
would
suggest
that
thei
were
aid
by
a
sex
therapist
.

the
look
of
the
film
is
to
suggest
that
it
follow
the
translat
of
the
inspir
book
from
the
film
wa
written
.

the
translat
,
``
dream
novel
,
''
make
you
thing
that
the
film
should
have
been
titl
dream
film
.

there
is
a
notic
amount
of
graini
to
the
film
.

rather
than
complain
about
it
as
some
mai
and
alreadi
have
,
see
it
as
a
style
of
shoot
.

i
would
gather
that
kubrick
got
on
anoth
light
kick
shoot
thi
and
shot
with
as
much
natur
light
as
he
could
.

thi
and
the
film
look
like
it
wa
push
anoth
two
stop
to
add
more
grain
and
brighten
it
slightli
.

as
an
auteur
and
stickler
for
detail
,
kubrick
seem
to
be
a
bit
lax
on
thi
on
.

the
film
look
great
,
but
there
ar
a
good
deal
of
blooper/flub
that
occur
.

you
see
lot
of
boom
shot
-lrb-
in
reflect
-rrb-
and
you
see
the
camera
at
least
twice
.

month
for
thi
?

wow
.

reflect
is
the
biggest
killer
for
thi
film
.

their
apart
and
almost
everyth
in
the
film
cast
reflect
and
the
crew
can
be
seen
in
these
,
some
quit
glaringli
.

on
more
topic
of
heat
discuss
:
i
saw
the
``
austin
power
''
version
,
and
to
be
perfectli
frank
,
unless
you
know
where
the
overlai
ar
suppos
to
be
,
you
'll
probabl
not
see
them
.

two
girl
stand
next
to
each
other
look
a
littl
suspici
,
but
i
can
wait
for
the
unrat
version

it
's
got
sex
in

valu
.

but
thei
all
serv
to
show

i
recommend
thi

highli
on
mani
merit

cruis

kidman
ar
rare
togeth
for
longer
thanminut
after
the
open
scene

and
the
