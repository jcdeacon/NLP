.

not
quit
the
denmark
of
the
1600

,
the

attir
is
someth
of
a
cross
between

everi
scene
truli
revolv
around
hamlet
,
as
much
a
tribut
to
branagh
's
act
and
direct
as
to
shakespear
's
manuscript
.

hamlet
seem
to
be
a
who
's
who
of
shakespearean-train
actor
,
so
watch
them
perform
the
craft
for
which
thei
have
much
love
is
a
delight
in
itself
.

juli
christi
,
as
hamlet
's
mother
gertrud
,
and
derek
jacobi
as
hi
murder
uncl
claudiu
both
fill
the
classic
role
superbl
,
as
do
mani
of
the
support
player
.

kate

lover
ophelia
,
doe
an
outstand
job
demonstr
the
charact
's
plummet
to
the
depth
of
dispair
and
mad
.

richard
brier
as
ophelia
's
father
,
poloniu
,
and
michael
molonei
as
her
brother
,
laert
,
ar
equal
convinc
.

nichola
farrel
as
hamlet
's
trust
friend
horatio
,
and
timothi
spall
and
reec
dinsdal
as
the
two-time
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
round
out
the
excel
core
cast
.

hamlet
also
seem
to
be
a
film
in
which
someon
tri
to
stuff
as
mani
well
known
actor
as
possibl
.

in
some
case
,
thi
made
for
interest
scene
.

billi
crystal
is
surprisingli
good
as
the
gravedigg
who
unearth
the
skull
of
yorick
,
whom
hamlet
knew
quit
well
.

crystal
prove
himself
abl
to
deliv
the
line
with
both
the
time
of
a
classic
actor
and
the
verbal
counten
of
a
comedian
,
and
the
result
is
a
veri
funni
scene
.

howev
,
charleton
heston
,
whom
mani
might
think
would
butcher
shakespear
,
is
the
biggest
surpris
of
all
.

as
the
player
king
,
the
leader
of
a
troup
of
travel
actor
,
he
is
absolut
breathtak
when
narrat
the
stori
of
priam
and
hecuba
.

part
of
hi
monologu
is
overlaid
with
a
visual
enact
of
the
stori
-lrb-
with
sir
john
gielgud
and
judi
dench
-rrb-
,
but
thi
is
most
unfortun
,
for
it
rob
heston
of
some
of
the
attent
which
he
deserv
at
thi
time
.

hi
off-camera
speak
,
while
grip
,
sort
of
downplai
the
scene
to
a
narrat
done
by
ani
other
well-voic
actor
.

i
wish
branagh
had
chosen
to
allow
us
to
envis
in
our
own
mind
the
scene
which
heston
lai
out
,
and
let
the
vener
actor
have
the
attent
.

unfortun
,
there
were
some
cast
choic
which
led
to
poor
distract
.

jack
lemmon
,
an
excel
actor
,
just
ca
n't
do
shakespear
.

as
marcellu
,
the
guard
who
see
the
elder
hamlet
's
ghost
,
lemmon
sadli
underperform
and
is
shown
up
left
and
right
by
those
around
him
.

gerard
depardieu
,
anoth
talent
actor
,
is
wast
when
given
littl
more
than
the
utter
of
``
ye
,
my
lord
''
and
``
no
,
my
lord
''
in
the
role
of
reynaldo
.

richard
attenborough
ha
a
-lrb-
liter
-rrb-
walk-on
role
,
show
up
at
the
eleventh
hour
as
the
english
ambassador
.

i
think
he
had
two
line
.

then
there
is
rufu
sewel
as
fortinbra
of
norwai
.

when
i
went
to
see
danger
beauti
earlier
thi
year
,
two
ladi
behind
me
kept
comment
about
how
handsom
he
wa
.

if
bulg
ey
ar
your
idea
of
handsom
,
well
i
guess
comic
actor
marti
feldman
wa
some
kind
of
sex
symbol
to
you
.

hamlet
is
a
complic
tale
of
treacheri
and
reveng
in
which
triumph
and
defeat
becom
on
.

branagh
attempt
to
help
us
out
with
some
of
the
intricaci
by
visual
repres
some
of
the
more
elus
stretch
of
dialogu
by
present
them
as
flashback-type
imag
.

thi
onli
work
about
half
the
time
,
and
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
been
just
as
well
to
do
without
them
.

you
do
n't
have
to
be
some
kind
of
geniu
to
appreci
shakespear
,
but
it
is
quit
difficult
to
understand
unless
you
have
the
time
to
read
or
hear
it
carefulli
and
repeatedli
.

the
altern
method
of
comprehens
is
that
with
which
most
of
us
ar
familiar
,
the
high
school
english
cours
.

in
it
,
you
ar
hopefulli
fortun
enough
to
have
an
educ
will
to
help
you
with
the
plot
point
and
nuanc
essenti
to
understand
a
plai
written
in
the
rigmarol
known
as
the
king
's
english
.

or
i
suppos
you
could
just
read
the
cliff
note
.
