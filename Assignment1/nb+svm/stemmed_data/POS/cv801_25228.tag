.

thei

ar
try
to
see
why
he
's
on
top
and
why
thei
ar
chase
after

.

what
make

film
differ
than
the
other
,
is
it
blatant
religi
messag
,
compar
orthodox
religion
to
what
thei

,
as
both

sell
their
product
.

and
how
after
each
on
's
psych
is
strip
clean
by
the
other
,
there
is
a
paus
and
some
lesson
about
life
ha
sunk
in
that
is
pertin
to
each
.

the
goal
in
the
movi
is
not
in
liter
land
the
big
kahuna
,
but
in
find
out
what
bill
of

salesmen
.

larri
and
phil
have
on
wai
of
do
thing
and
have
no
qualm
of
incorpor
a
sale
pitch
as
part
of
their
life
.

bob
think
he
is
abov
the
frai
and
he
pitch
everi
chanc
he
can
get
about
hi
belief
in
jesu
christ
.

hi
vacuou
charact
and
smug
outlook
on
life
ar
cover
by
a
disarm
smile
and
an
eager
for
him
to
prove
in
hi
action
the
word
of
jesu
he
liter
believ
in
.

bob
is
a
baptist
,
who
take
a
veri
non-question
and
liter
attitud
about
religion
.

to
just
look
at
anoth
woman
and
lust
after
her
is
a
sin
,
accord
to
the
wai
he
read
the
bibl
.

when
ask
by
larri
why
he
marri
hi
wife
,
he
seem
puzzl
and
ca
n't
even
sai
becaus
he
love
her
,
onli
that
marriag
is
someth
sacr
to
him
.

the
contrast
in
their
person
is
stark
.

larri
is
all
busi
,
he
simpli
want
to
close
the
sale
.

he
come
into
the
room
pump
for
the
convent
,
us
hi
attack
mode
to
establish
how
seriou
he
is
about
be
a
salesman
.

he
critic
phil
for
be
so
placid
,
for
get
such
a
small
suit
,
for
have
the
cheap
food
trai
of
carrot
stick
rather
than
the
on
of
stuf
shrimp
,
and
for
be
burn-out
.

he
tell
him
to
go
on
a
vacat
.

get
a
woman
.

while
phil
is
reflect
on
where
all
hi
best
year
have
gone
for
him
and
is
contempl
a
career
chang
,
now
that
he
isand
is
painfulli
divorc
hi
wife
,
after
have
live
too
lone
a
life
on
the
road
for
too
long
.

he
now
find
himself
suffer
from
some
troubl
dream
and
question
what
he
believ
in
.

he
ha
alwai
been
a
charmer
,
shake
everyon
's
hand
,
try
to
pleas
hi
client
while
try
to
make
the
sale
.

larri
is
more
aggress
as
a
salesman
,
he
is
alwai
a
heart
attack
awai
from
everi
big
sale
.

in
contrast
,
bob
is
onli
in
hi
twenti
and
everyth
seem
fresh
to
him
.

thi
is
hi
first
time
for
him
on
the
road
.

when
dick
fuller
doe
n't
arriv
at
the
parti
the
salesmen
throw
,
larri
becom
confront
and
ask
phil
if
he
spoke
to
the
man
himself
about
the
gather
.

when
told
that
he
spoke
to
the
secretari
,
larri
throw
a
tantrum
and
is
resign
to
go
back
to
their
home
offic
without
the
new
account
.

but
when
thei
start
talk
to
bob
,
whom
thei
forc
to
act
as
the
bartend
,
thei
ar
surpris
to
learn
that
fuller
did
inde
come
but
wa
wear
anoth
man
's
name
tag
and
that
bob
spent
the
entir
even
consol
the
tycoon
over
hi
recent
deceas
dog
and
then
talk
to
him
about
jesu
.

bob
then
tell
the
boi
about
a
privat
parti
fuller
is
attend
afterward
,
and
that
he
invit
bob
to
attend
.

larri
and
phil
ca
n't
fathom
how
bob
did
n't
make
a
sale
pitch
.

but
thei
soon
take
anoth
tact
and
decid
to
prep
bob
on
how
to
get
fuller
's
attent
about
their
compani
's
product
as
thei
sent
him
off
to
meet
fuller
,
and
will
await
hi
return
in
the
hotel
room
.

these
two
sharp
salesmen
ar
reduc
to
wait
for
thi
smug
kid
to
come
back
and
tell
them
he
save
their
ass
.

the
ironi
of
their
situat
is
plai
out
in
the
dark
of
the
hotel
room
,
as
thei
stai
up
late
into
the
night
try
to
make
sens
out
of
their
live
.

these
three
perform
were
outstand
,
each
understand
what
their
role
call
for
,
each
come
through
with
a
marvel
perform
.

the
onli
problem
with
the
film
,
is
that
it
more
of
a
plai
than
a
cinemat
experi
.

but
the
insight
dialogu
and
refresh
dramat
,
give
it
an
intellig
sell
point
and
make
it
a
good
product
to
see
.
