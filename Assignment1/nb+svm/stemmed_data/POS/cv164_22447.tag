wa
almost
indescrib
.

evok
pleasant
childhood
memori
is
onli
on
of
the
mani
thing
`
a
christma
stori
'
doe
so
well
.

here
ar
a
few
featur
that
make
thi
film
such
a
charm
littl
packag
for
everybodi
dure
the
holidai
season
:
1
-rrb-
period
detail
.

thi
film
is
base
on
the
memoir
of
late
humorist
jean
shepard
,
who
share
hi
experi
as
a
young
boi
live
in
the
1940
's
with
love
detail
.

shepard
narrat
from
a
first
person
point-of-view
,
divulg
hi
variou
adventur
on
snowi
decemb
,
in
which
vision
of
take
aim
with
hi
new
bb
gun
replac
that
of
sugarplum
danc
in
hi
head
.

shepard
's
first-hand
commentari
of
sever
situat
is
not
onli
downright
hilari
,
but
also
witti
and
warm
,
with
variou
metaphor
mean
that
ring
perfectli
with
the
essenc
of
comic
time
.

on
top
of
that
,
young
billingslei
's
stupefi
reaction
to
each
predica
is
absolut
perfect
in
contrast
with
the
narrat
.

director
bob
clark
captur
the
look
and
feel
of
the
era
with
wonder
technic
.

i
can
hardli
imagin
a
more
accur
depict
of
what
christma
for
young
ralphi
must
have
been
like
.

2
-rrb-
mom
and
dad
.

both
melinda
dillon
-lrb-
as
mom
-rrb-
and
darren
mcgavin
-lrb-
as
the
old
man
'
-rrb-
ar
perfect
in
their
role
.

it
's
hard
to
fathom
a
more
agreeabl
pair
for
the
requir
of
a
stori
like
thi
on
,
with
each
possess
at
least
on
memor
trait
that
instantli
separ
them
from
the
wooden
caricatur
that
could
have
been
featur
.

for
instanc
,
he
is
a
bloodthirsti
turkei
hound
,
and
she
is
forgiv
and
understand
when
it
come
to
some
seriou
issu
.

in
portrai
the
writer
as
a
persist
but
mild-manner
young
lad
,
peter
billingslei
ha
struck
quit
the
chord
.

hi
perform
is
richli
textur
,
make
all
of
the
humor
situat
he
stumbl
into
radiat
with
flavor
and
enjoy
.

which
bring
us
to
...
3
-rrb-
the
comic
situat
.

there
ar
plenti
of
memor
moment
in
`
a
christma
stori
'
.

moment
that
undoubtedli
will
improv
in
comic
potenc
upon
each
new
view
,
with
so
much
more
to
explor
and
to
cherish
.

i
am
particularli
partial
of
the
f-word
scene
'
,
in
which
ralphi
blurt
out
the
shock
four-letter
obscen
while
help
the
old
man
in
the
yard
.

again
,
shepard
's
method
of
handl
thi
amus
scenario
is
noth
short
of
comic
wizardri
.

the
numer
sequenc
that
stick
in
on
's
mind
includ
,
of
cours
,
the
famou
depart
store
santa
scene-in
which
billingslei
ha
some
problem
in
tell
old
saint
nick
what
he
want
under
the
tree
.

i
could
go
on
,
but
i
'll
finish
on
thi
note
:
`
a
christma
stori
'
is
a
standout
among
holidai
movi
,
becaus
it
captur
so
much
in
a
meager
90
minut
.

not
onli
is
it
funni
,
it
's
often
genuin
hilari
...
.

not
to
mention
warm
,
fluffi
and
touch
in
all
the
appropri
place
.

i
plan
on
make
`
a
christma
stori
'
a
christma
tradit
.

why
do
n't
you
?

your
comment
