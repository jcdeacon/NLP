dismiss
the
notion
of

show
that
greed

come
in

anoth
similar
with
fight
club
is
that
both
film
ar
not
action

.

some
peopl
ar
convinc

thi
is
too
good
to
be
true
.

after
stumbl
into
a
room
at
the
wrong
time
,
he
know
there
is
someth
no

about

at

;
continu
with
the
american
dream
and
make

or
tell
the
author
that
someth
fishi

ribisi
is
believ
as
seth
especi
when
he
share
scene
with
ron

,
plai
seth
's
dad
.

the
two
have
perfect
chemistri
as
a
troubl
father
and
son
try
to
impress
each
other
and
simultan
impress
themselv
.

the
transit
from
anger
to
sympathi
that
these
scene
contain
ar
the
standout
segment
of
the
entir
film
.

the
support
cast
of
greedi
co-worker
is
also
flawless
.

ben
affleck
shine
in
a
short
but
sweet
perform
as
a
recruit
for
the
compani
,
nicki

fabul
as

the
energi
of
the
cast
as
a
whole
make
boiler
room
well
pace
and
never
bore
.

the
onli
major
error
in
the
film
is
that
noth
major
happen
.

there
is
no
big
plot
twist
or
climat
point
to
make
the
film
more
memor
.

due
to
the
lack
of
a
major
event
,
boiler
room
never
find
a
suitabl
genr
to
fit
into
.

the
movi
is
not
intens
enough
to
be
a
thriller
,
the
romant
segment
involv
seth
and
abbi
-lrb-
nia
long
-rrb-
ar
not
properli
final
,
and
the
dialogu
is
n't
funni
enough
to
make
it
a
comedi
.

in
have
troubl
to
character
the
movi
as
a
whole
,
boiler

is
slightli
confus
at
time
.

it
doe
n't
seem
to
know
which
categori
to
fit
itself
into
.

on
satisfi

scene
could
have
chang
the
whole
film
for
the
better

otherwis
,
the
movi
is
fun
to
watch
thank
to
it
live
