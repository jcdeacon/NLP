-rrb-
***

-lrb-
out
of
four
-rrb-
star
bruce
campbel
,
sarah
berri
,
dan
hick
,
kassi
depaiva
,
and
denis
bixler
is
evil
dead
ii
a
bad
movi
?

it
's
full
of
terribl
act
,
pointless
violenc
,
and
plot
hole
yet
it
remain
a
cult
classic
nearli
fifteen
year
after
it
releas
.

explain
why
thi
movi
stand
out
from
other
with
similar
plot
-lrb-
includ
the
origin
evil
dead
-rrb-
is
extrem
difficult
.

`
five
peopl
strand
in
a
log
cabin
in
the
middl
of
nowher
struggl
to
surviv
viciou
attack
from
a
varieti
of
ugli
,
hairi
,
wart
cover
monster
.
'

`
come
on
i
saw
a
movi
just
like
that
on
monster
vision
last
week
.

why
should
i
see
it
again
?
'

`
no
evil
dead
ii
is
differ
,
it
's
funni
.
'

mayb
i
am
and
mayb
director
sam
raimi
is
as
well
to
creat
such
an
enigma
of
a
movi
.

hi
uniqu
execut
is
as
sarcast
as
subtl
,
as
disturb
as
it
is
hilari
.

an
exampl
of
raimi
's
odd
approach
:
a
monster
-lrb-
formerli
protagonist
ash
's
girlfriend
of
all
peopl
-rrb-
is
cut
in
half
by
a
chainsaw
and
a
tidal
wave
of
blood
come
from
the
open
wound
.

sure
it
's
over-the-top
,
but
it
is
so
over-the-top
that
it
is
laugh
out
loud
funni
;
just
try
watch
ash
with
a
straight
face
as
he
unexpectedli
is
shower
with
ten
gallon
of
blood
,
stain
hi
face
and
knock
him
back
a
few
feet
.

the
whole
movi
is
like
thi
,
watch
ash
get
beat
up
,
watch
ash
defeat
the
monster
,
watch
ash
get
beat
up
again
by
anoth
even
zanier
monster
.

the
more
repetit
and
unrealist
the
movi
get
,
the
more
amus
it
becom
.

no
matter
how
sick
it
mai
sound
,
it
is
funni
to
watch
bruce
ampbel
's
ash
get
hi
butt
kick
everi
five
minut
.

and
raimi
take
advantag
,
he
ha
ash
torment
by
the
head
of
hi
girlfriend
,
by
the
bodi
of
an
old
ladi
,
even
by
hi
own
right
hand
.

like
the
less
superior
idl
hand
,
we
watch
ash
uncontrol
hit
himself
over
and
over
again
until
he
is
forc
to
cut
off
hi
own
bodi
part
.

but
it
doe
n't
end
,
ash
now
ha
to
fight
hi
sever
hand
which
now
move
with
the
same
celer
as
thing
from
the
addam
famili
.

all
of
these
event
,
thrown
at
you
from
minut
on
with
roller
coaster-like
camera
movement
,
at
first
becom
shock
,
then
inexplic
funni
.

raimi
expect
the
audienc
to
laugh
and
as
the
film
progress
,
he
seem
to
be
enjoi
himself
even
more
by
borrow
the
classic
mirror
scene
from
the
marx
brother
'
duck
soup
,
then
bring
more
charact
into
the
pictur
to
comic
kill
them
off
.

with
a
run
time
of
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
,
raimi
get
awai
with
the
imposs
,
make
a
horror
film
with
more
gore
than
plot
and
intention
more
laugh
than
scare
.

end
evil
dead
ii
with
an
open
for
the
third
film
in
the
seri
,
raimi
obvious
had
a
lot
of
fun
make
thi
movi
and
could
n't
wait
to
make
it
's
sequel
.
