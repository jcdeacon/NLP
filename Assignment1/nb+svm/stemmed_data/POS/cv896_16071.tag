there
is
no
wai
to
know
how
accur

that
much
of
it

came
from

jame

,
we
learn
quickli
wa
,
what
mani
peopl
refer
to
him
as
in
the
film
,
``
a
dirti
old
man

''

in
on
of
the
open

,
a
young

enthusiast
visit

the

becaus
of
thi

we
know
exactli
what
it
is

want
when
he
ask
clayton
to
pose
for
him
for
a

,
later
make
the
excus
that

clayon

and
doe

becom
more
and
more
intrigu

the
stori
whale
tell
him
about
hi
past
.

certainli
,
the
relationship
between
whale
and
boon
is
head
for
a
downfal
,
sinc
whale
start
to
grow
a
deep
love
for
thi
young
man
,
even
though
boon
is
not
gai
,
and
whale
himself
realiz
he
is
near
the
conclus
to
hi
life
,
as
he
begin
to
seldom
suffer
mild
stroke
and
moment
of
true
catharsi
.

``
god
and
monster
''
is
an
intim
and
seemingli
respect
portrait
of
a
director
who
wa
forc
to
becom
somewhat
of
an
outcast
,
due
to
hi
sexual
prefer
,
and
never
got
the
recognit
he
would
have
like
,
sinc
he
long
to
be
refer
to
as
a
``
motion
pictur
director
,
''
rather
than
a
``
horror
director
.
''

and
in
on
heartbreak
scene
,
he
attend
a
parti
with
boon
be
hi
guest
,
held
by
director
georg
cuckor
,
and
find
that
mani
of
the
other
attende
do
not
recogn
him
anymor
.

it
is
evid
that
whale
's
first
love
in
hi
life
wa
make
movi
,
and
when
hi
career
ultim
fell
apart
,
so
did
hi
passion
in
life
.

as
plai
brilliantli
by
ian
mckellen
,
jame
whale
come
off
as
a
sad
,
but
dignifi
man
,
and
a
person
who
wa
not
afraid
to
stand
out
from
other
,
just
as
long
as
he
knew
he
wa
be
true
to
himself
.

he
never
hid
the
fact
that
he
wa
gai
,
howev
,
even
if
it
meant
threaten
hi
filmmak
profess
,
and
it
wa
thi
unblink
honesti
that
made
him
a
great
person
.

through
the
complic
relationship
that
develop
between
whale
and
boon
,
boon
,
of
cours
,
onli
thing
of
whale
as
a
possibl
friend
or
someon
he
can
talk
to
,
while
it
mean
so
much
more
to
whale
,
who
see
boon
as
sort
of
hi
salvat
in
life
.

although
boon
is
onli
in
a
dead-end
job
as
a
garden
of
peopl
's
home
,
whale
view
him
as
the
ideal
man
,
not
onli
on
that
is
good-look
,
even
though
it
is
thi
attract
that
first
begin
hi
feel
,
but
on
that
will
actual
listen
to
him
.

sinc
whale
live
with
onli
hi
loyal
,
but
disapprov
maid
-lrb-
touchingli
portrai
by
lynn
redgrav
-rrb-
,
it
is
boon
that
whale
can
talk
to
in
hi
ultim
reclus
from
the
world
,
and
the
onli
reason
whale
final
decid
to
attend
the
gather
of
georg
cuckor
.

although
an
extrem
fine
and
matur
pictur
,
a
few
small
element
hold
the
film
back
from
ultim
great
.

it
is
appreci
that
the
film
doe
not
pull
for
ani
obviou
or
overli
dramat
stori
develop
,
but
it
is
a
littl
thin
,
and
the
structur
of
the
``
on-again-off-again
''
friendship
at
the
film
's
center
is
fairli
predict
.

we
know
earli
on
where
these
two
charact
ar
head
,
and
we
can
guess
that
there
will
be
a
final
confront
between
the
two
as
the
tension
slowli
build
.

in
lesser
hand
,
thi
set-up
might
have
felt
too
calcul
,
but
it
is
not
in
the
surprisingli
deft
treatment
and
write
that
help
the
film
to
be
much
more
than
thi
.

also
,
a
subplot
is
briefli
brought
up
between
clayton
and
a
waitress
work
at
a
bar
-lrb-
effect

,
but
abruptli
drop
and
never
brought
up
again
.

if
the
film
wa
not
go
to
follow
up
on
thi
side
stori
,
then
it
,
perhap
,
should
have
been
taken

``
god
and
monster
''
is
a
heartfelt
and
intellig
motion
pictur
,
impress
direct
by
bill
condon
,
who
,
i
sens
,
relat
to
or
fulli
understand
the
mean
behind
the
curiou
relationship
between
whale
and
boon
.

the
film
also
plai
as
a
tribut
to
a
fine
man
who
met
an
untim
end
.

walk
awai
from
``
god
and
monster
,
''
it
wa
ian
mckellen
's
marvel
and
astound
perform
that
left
the
most
impress
on
me
,
and
i
doubt
there
could
have
been
anyon
who
could
have
step
into
the
role
more
fulli
and
believ
.

it
is
a
sad
testament
when
a
person
's
true
talent
and
love
is
unfairli
taken
awai
from
them
,
base
on
the
scrutin
and
judgement
of
their
person
life
,
which
,
iron
enough
,
is
no
on
els

busi
in
the
first
place
