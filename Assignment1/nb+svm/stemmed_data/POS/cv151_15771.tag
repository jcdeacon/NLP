and
lost

in

the
princ

,
dreamwork
ha
strai
from

and
creat
a
genuin

the

the

howev
,
wa
that
the

not
just
becaus
thei
look
cool
but
also
as
a
method
of
advanc
the
plot
.

name
,
some
of
the
most
import
action
sequenc
-lrb-
like
the
part
of
the
red
sea
-rrb-
were
done
almost
entir
in
3d
.

dreamwork
is
the
first
studio
to
prove
that
thei
've
got
the
stuff
of
success
,
and
that
thei
're
capabl
of
challeng
disnei
.

the
stori
is
also
well-written
,
and
the
charact
voic
with
talent
.

for
the
most
part
,
the
plot
follow
it
sourc
materi
--
the
book
of
exodu
--
although
onli
in
the
most
gener
sens
.

the
writer
took
a
few
creativ
liberti
,
and
most
do
not
damag
the
stori
in
ani
wai
.

in
fact
,
the
shakespearean
relationship
between
mose
-lrb-
val
kilmer
-rrb-
and
the
pharaoh
rames
-lrb-
ralph
fienn
-rrb-
make
the
stori
more
interest
if
anyth
.

mose
,
a
hebrew
,
is
save
from
the
slaughter
of
the
firstborn
son
by
hi
mother
when
she
set
him
in
a
basket
on
the
nile
;
he
float
into
the
pharaoh
seti
-lrb-
patrick
stewart
-rrb-
's
palac
and
is
taken
in
by
the
royal
famili
.

mose
grow
up
but
learn
of
hi
heritag
and
flee
into
the
desert
,
where
he
discov
the
burn
bush
and
is
commiss
by
god
to
return
to
egypt
and
free
the
slave
.

by
thi
time
,
rames
is
now
pharaoh
,
and
the
two
brother
,
now
on
opposit
side
of
the
line
,
face
off
in
a
battl
of
will
and
divin
intervent
.

the
cast
of
voic
is
most
impress
,
and
also
includ
such
noteabl
as
sandra
bullock
,
jeff
goldblum
,
danni
glover
,
and
steve
martin
.

the
script
doe
not
have
a
lot
of
on-liner
in
it
,
and
god
is
reduc
to
a
voic
that
might
well
be
mistaken
for
the
same
on
that
spoke
to
kevin
costner
in
field
of
dream
,
but
overal
the
stori
is
excit
and
interest
.

it
's
decidedli
for
an
older
crowd
,
and
the
tyke
who
have
n't
had
a
few
year
of
religion
class
will
be
hopelessli
lost
.

but
for
those
who
make
the
bid
,
the
princ
of
egypt
can
be
a
great
watch
.
