full
effect
,
launch
unbeliev
forc
against

who

not
onli
is
imhotep
furiou
with
those
who
awok
him
,
he
is
also
out
to
restor
the
life
of
hi
girlfriend
that
lost
her
life
long
ago
in
ancient
egypt
.

do
n't
expect
huge
thing
out
of
the
mummi
,
but
just
expect
to
have
a
good
time
.

thi
movi
is
extrem
campi
and
plai
out
like
an
old
horror
film
with
beef
up
special
effect
,
which
mai
turn
off
some
viewer
.

on
the
other
hand
,
thi
type
of
film
is
on
of
my
favorit
,
but
that
's
up
to
you
to
decid
.

there
is
on
thing
that
definit
not
campi
or
corni
about
the
mummi
though
.

the
state
of
the
art
special
effect
take
you
into
a
complet
differ
world
.

we
ar
dazzl
by
face
rise
out
of
the
desert
,
swarm
of
beetl
and
locust
,
and
even
creatur
crawl
under
a
human
's
skin
.

these
mai
have
been
in
other
movi
befor
,
but
not
like
in
the
mummi
.

as
of
now
,
the
mummi
hold
the
titl
for
best
special
effect
of
thi
year
,
but
all
thi
could
chang
when
star
war
episod
1
:
the
phantom
menac
is
releas
into
theater
across
the
countri
.

in
the
past
,
brendan
fraser
ha
plai
mainli
comed
role
.

when
plai
``
georg
''
in
disnei
's
georg
of
the
jungl
,
he
wa
mainli
not
known
by
anyon
.

i
would
sai
that
god
and
monster
is
the
film
that
gave
him
a
name
,
and
now
the
mummi
will
give
him
a
name
amongst
teen
.

in
the
mummi
,
fraser
get
to
plai
an
action
hero
,
and
i
like
him
in
thi
sort
of
role
over
the
comed
role
,
as
in
the
film
blast
from
the
past
and
georg
of
the
jungl
.

although
brendan
fraser
is
great
,
rachel
weisz
give
the
best
perform
among
the
cast
.

weisz
realli
remind
me
of
a
charact
from
an
old
,
horror
film
.

the
wai
she
act
,
look
,
and
talk
all
remind
me
of
someon
not
from
thi
time
.

evelyn
is
probabl
the
onli
charact
that
wa
likabl
,
consid
that
the
other
charact
,
like
john
hannah
's
,
did
n't
get
much
person
attent
.

in
mani
film
,
when
differ
genr
ar
mix
,
the
mix
usual
work
,
and
i
like
it
for
the
most
part
.

in
the
mummi
though
,
not
all
of
the
mix
work
.

there
ar
some
scene
that
have
a
lot
of
potenti
horror
,
some
with
potenti
comedi
,
some
with
potenti
drama
,
and
some
with
potenti
pure
action
,
but
the
film
tri
to
mix
them
togeth
too
often
for
the
mix
to
work
.

the
mummi
could
have
gotten
an
``
a
''
rate
from
me
if
it
had
gone
pure
with
on
of
these
.

i
did
n't
mind
the
corni
on-liner
here
and
there
dure
action
sequenc
,
but
it
certainli
could
have
done
without
them
.

the
cinematographi
is
amaz
in
the
mummi
.

particularli
in
on
scene
depict
ancient
egypt
,
we
ar
taken
into
a
veri
fun
portray
of
egypt
,
mummi
,
and
the
treasur
left
behind
by
the
ancient
egyptian
.

the
costum
design
in
the
film
is
also
up
there
with
the
great
cinematographi
.

from
ancient
egyptian
outfit
to
origin
troop
outfit
,
the
costum
ar
alwai
top
notch
.

the
bottom
line-with
the
mummi
,
the
summer
is
off
to
it
usual
great
start
.
