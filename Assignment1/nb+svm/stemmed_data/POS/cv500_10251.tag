when

just
a

sam

when
cutback
led
to
the

sam

result
in

in

hi

he
's
not

somewhat

n't

by
the

that

n't

overal
,
he
's
just
like
you

me-except
that
he
ha
the
capac
to
view
the

we

alda
and

both
turn
in
fine
perform
that
fit
like

then
there
is

who

she
fall

to
becom
a
student
taught

well
in

kirshner
's
credit
ar
rel
small
for
now
,
includ
role
in
film
like
exotica
and
the
forgett

still
,
kirshner
's
charact
transform
show
that
she
ha
shine
abil
to
plai
both
good
girl
and
kinda-bitchi-in-a-reserv-wai

i
would
n't
mind
see
her
in
some
more
preval
part
,
where
perhap
her
talent
will
be
abl
to
blossom
more
fulli
onscreen
.

while
the
viewpoint
of
the
media
as
a
greedi
,
self-righteou
monster
ha
inde
been
tackl
befor
,
mad
citi
provid
a
solid
two
hour
of
enjoy
.

hoffman
and
travolta
ar
both
excel
actor
,
and
see
them
togeth
is
a
real
treat
.

thei
both
do
a
great
job
at
smoothli
and
natur
becom
their
charact
,
and
thei
provid
enough
chemistri
for
us
to
genuin
care
for
both
.

there
is
quit
a
bit
of
humor
in
thi
film
,
and
without
it
,
it
could
've
fallen
into
a
drab
,
clich
social
statement
more
like
to
garner
sleep
from
the
audienc
than
applaus
.

thi
is
n't
a
flick
that
will
grip
at
both
your
funni
bone
and
your
heart
,
but
it
will
lightli
touch
both
,
make
for
a
recommend
movi
.

if
for
noth
more
than
the
opportun
to
watch
both
hoffman
and
travolta
at
the

time

i
