i
think
it
probabl
becaus
thei
both
delv
in
a
stori
of
global
proport
and
indulg
in
the
premis
of
hope
,
faith
and
life
itself
.

both
do
not
depend
heavili
on
ey-candi
in
the

of

director
mimi

who
won
numer
award

seri
,
and
made
her
debut
with
peacekeep
last
year
-rrb-
is
definit
a
director
to
watch
.

despit
thi
be
the
first
of
the
two
meteor
movi
thi
summer
-lrb-
the
other
be
armageddon
-rrb-
,
i
think
there
will
be
stark
differ
in
the
approach
to
the
subject
matter
.

while
the
premis
of
both
mai
be
the
same
,
execut
and
focu
of
the
film
will
in
fact
show
that
deep
impact
ha
more
focu
on
human
element
than
armageddon
,
which
is
done
by
the
team
which
brought
us
bad
boi
,
crimson
tide
and
the
rock
.

deep
impact
should
be
abl
to
satisfi
a
varieti
of
audienc
;
from
the
most
action-crave
to
those
who
just
want
to
immers
into
it
manipul
but
nonetheless
dramat
premis
.
