to
be
a
full-time
inform
.

warn
:
spoiler
follow
in
next
paragraph
.

the
bank
robber
ar
setup
and
caught
in
the
act
and
the
mob
boss
is
convinc
coyl
did
it
and
give
dillon
the
contract
to
take
care
of
hi
friend
.

the
contemptu
dillon
befriend
coyl
and
treat
him
to
a
steak
dinner
and
take
him
to
a
bruin
hockei
game
while
get
him
booz
up
.

coyl
take
a
look
at
the
young
bruin
star
bobbi
orr
from
hi
upper
deck
seat
and
sai
,
``
to
be
young
like
that
and
have
hi
futur
,
he
's
the
greatest
hockei
player
in
the
world
.
''

dillon
then
take
the
drunken
coyl
for
a
long
drive
and
execut
him
mob-style
,
have
a
kid
who
work
for
him
dump
the
bodi
in
some
bad
section
of
boston
.

thi
is
a
great
atmospher
film
due
to
the
realist
noir
mood
it
set
,
of
the
hopeless
situat
the
low-level
crimin
ar
in
,
and
how
thei
ar
forc
to
live
with
fear
and
the
uncertainti
of
what
horribl
thing
will
happen
next
.

the
citi
street
ar
ugli
,
the
gangster
ar
shown
to
be
capabl
of
ani
action
to
defend
their
own
interest
,
whether
it
is
betray
or
murder
.

there
is
a
fatalist
feel
about
their
live
,
someth
robert
mitchum
wear
as
easili
as
other
put
on
a
hat
.

mitchum
give
thi
film
all
the
intens
and
purpos
it
need
,
as
it
overcom
a
thin
plot
.

it
make
you
see
the
charact
for
what
thei
ar
without
ani
fals
sympathi
for
them
.

mitchum
is
a
loser
;
and
,
that
he
live
so
long
,
is
a
tribut
to
hi
skill
as
a
survivor
.

but
in
the
end
,
he
even
lose
the
respect
he
had
among
hi
underworld
friend
as
a
standup
gui
,
as
he
wrestl
with
hi
code
of
honor
and
lost
even
that
battl
.
