by
matt
hooper
-lrb-
richard
dreyfuss
-rrb-
,
a
young
,
ambiti
shark
expert
from
the
marin
institut
.

hooper
is
as
fascin
by
the
shark
as
he
is
determin
to
help
brodi
stop
it
--
hi
knowledg
about
the
exact
work
of
the

-lrb-
``
it

-rrb-
make
it
that
much
more
terrifi
.

when
vaughn
final
relent
,
hooper
and
brodi
join
a
crusti

``
jaw
''
is
a
thriller
with
a
keen
sens
of
humor
and
an
incred
sens
of
pace
,
tension
,
and
horror
.

it
is
like
ten
movi
all
roll
into
on
,
and
it
's
no
wonder
it
took
america
by
storm
in
the
summer
of
1975
,
take
in
enough
monei
to
crown
it
the
box
offic
champ
of
all
time
-lrb-
until
it
wa
unceremoni
dethron
in
1977
by
``
star
war
''
-rrb-
.

even
todai
,
fascin
with
thi
film
is
on
par
with
hitchcock
's
``
psycho
,
''
and
it
never
seem
to
ag
.

although
grand
new
technolog
exist
that
make
the
technic
sequenc
,
includ
sever
mechan
shark
,
obsolet
,
none
of
it
could
improv
the
film
becaus
it
onli
would
lead
to
overkil
.

the
technic
limit
face
by
spielberg
in
1975
mai
have
actual
produc
a
better
film
becaus
it
forc
him
to
reli
on
tradit
cinemat
element
like
pace
,
character
,
sharp
edit
,
and
creativ
photographi
,
instead
of
simpli
dous
the

with

scheider
,
dreyfuss
,
and
shaw
were
known
actor
at
the
time
``
jaw
''
wa
made
,
but
none
of
them
had
the
draw
of
a
robert
redford
or
paul
newman
.

nevertheless
,
thi
film
guarante
them
all
success
career
becaus
each
gave
an
outstand
perform
and
refus
to
be
overshadow
by
the
shark
.

scheider
hit
just
the
right
note
as
a
sympathet
husband
and
father
caught
in
the
polit
quagmir
of

most
outstand
is
the

and
shaw

is
almost
a

of

we
ca

out
the
shark
itself
;
with
it
black
ey
,
endless
row
of
teeth
,
and
insati

,
it
is
basic
the
epitom
of
all
mankind

fear
about
what
