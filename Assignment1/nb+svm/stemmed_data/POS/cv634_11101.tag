``
gattaca
''
is
a
film
which
present
a
futur
where
societi
ha
answer
``
ye
''
to
thi
question
,

then
ponder
if

contrari
to
the
mislead
trailer
,
``
gattaca

is
not
a
sci-fi
thriller
,
in
the
wai
that
there
's
lot
of
murder
,
hitchcockian
suspens
,
and
chase
scene
.

thi
is
a
quiet
,
sad
film
about
intellig
theori

in
fact
,
the
film
seem
like
it
would
have
been
written

it

a
film
that
mai
like
becom
a
cult
hit
to
peopl
who
ar
frighten
by
a
promis
of
shallow
utopia
,
which
is
exactli
what

and
the

begin

kind
of
relationship
,
albeit
a
veri
shallow
on
sinc
romanc
is
deem
by
how
great
a
man
's
stat
ar
.

howev
,
a
murder
of
a
high-level
worker
at
hi
offic
is
kill
,
and
on
of
vincent/jerom
's
eyelash
is
found
by
the
anal
retent
investig
head
by
a
semi-wili
inspector
,
hugo
,
-lrb-
alan
arkin
-rrb-
,
and
none
other
than
vincent
's
long
lost
brother
,
anton
,
who
ha
n't
seen
him
sinc
thei
were
teenag
.

we
know
vincent/jerom
did
n't
do
it
,
but
with
hi
older
pictur
be
post
everywher
,
not
onli
vincent/jerom
's
in
troubl
,
but
also
the
real
jerom
,
who
's
as
much
in
it
as
he
is
.

howev
,
there
is
n't
mani
big
suspens
set
piec
,
which
is
actual
a
bless
becaus
if
thei
were
toss
in
,
the
film
would
lose
it
's
messag
and
descend
into
just
be
a
sci-fi
thriller
a
la
william
gibson
.

the
suspens
in
the
film
come
from
the
idea
that
vincent
and
jerom
can
easili
be
captur
just
by
drop
a
hair
or
dead
skin
.

while
there
ar
sever
scene
which
ar
pretti
frighten
,
there
ar
no
big
distract
from
the
point
of
the
film
,
much
to
the
dismai
of
commerci
audienc
.

what
is
actual
portrai
is
the
lack
of
life
in
the
utopian
societi
that
is
creat
.

iren
ha
no
real
spunk
in
her
life
,
and
is
rather
amaz
by
the
sheer
beauti
of
a
sunris
rather
than
genet
perfect
peopl
.

and
the
genet
flawless
jerom
is
in
actual
a
bitter
man
,
claim
that
hi
accid
wa
realli
no
accid
.

what
jerom
ha
done
is
fool
the
system
in
give
a
man
who
yearn
for
better
thing
a
chanc
at
that
,
and
the
end
is
shock
as
it
's
a
definit
work
of
dystopian
propaganda
,
but
doe
n't
have
the
down
end
of
other
work
of
thi
kind
.

the
product
design
of
thi
film
is
probabl
the
best
i
've
seen
thi
year
:
it
's
stun
,
veri
pleas
to
the
ey
,
but
still
veri
cold
.

sinc
genet
ha
rule
out
ani
chanc
of
improv
,
the
world
ha
cool
into
a
state
of
inhuman
,
and
the
set
echo
a
sens
of
shallow
miseri
.

and
the
sequenc
of
all
the
high-level
worker
do
their
job
ha
a
kind
of
gilliam-esqu
feel
to
it
,
show
the
nightmar
of
slip
into
a
routin
zombi-like
life
.

the
abil
to
perfect
peopl
ha
left
human
cold
and
gener
unhappi
.

the
act
from
everyon
is
great
,
with
thurman
give
a
wonderfulli
cold
perform
,
and
hawk
creat
a
charact
who
ha
been
beaten
down
by
the
system
but
ha
found
a
new
sens
of
optim
by
a
bitter
man
who
wa
will
to
give
it
out
anywai
-lrb-
interest
pointless
fact
:
uma
and
ethan
start
date
after
thi
film
,
and
current
she
is
pregnant
with
hi
child
-rrb-
.

but
the
best
perform
belong
to
jude
law
,
who
steal
everi
scene
he
's
in
,
and
creat
a
charact
fill
with
the
pessim
over
have
such
a
horribl
burden
place
on
hi
burden
.

i
think
that
peopl
ar
gener
tempt
by
the
fact
that
genet
can
actual
creat
perfect
in
a
child
,
but
whether
or
not
thei
would
actual
act
on
thi
temptat
is
someth
i
'm
not
sure
of
.

``
gattaca
''
warn
us
not
to
go
ani
farther
,
chiefli
becaus
we
'll
creat
a
world
of
elit
where
the
elit
ar
shallow
and
unhappi
,
and
as
bitter
and
angri
as
the
lesser
peopl
ar
.

and
when
i
see
a
possibl
futur
featur
a
12-finger
piano
player
,
well
folk
,
that
just
creep
me
out
.
