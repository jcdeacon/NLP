also
,
like
mel

epic
,
``
gladiat

ha
a
primarili
viscer
appeal
and
is
driven
forward
by
the
hero
's
anger
.

it
's
a
simpl
tale
of

maximu

the

``

would
the

there

lucilla

the
onli

what
spark
there
ar
between
her
and
maximu
ar
dampen
by
hi
devot
to
hi
dead

joaquin
phoenix
give
an
astound
perform
.

in
the
scene
where
commodu
kill
hi

,
phoenix
show
the
pain
of
a
son
who
ha
never
had
hi
father
's
love
or
pride

throughout
the
pictur
,
phoenix
manag
to
give
depth
to
a
charact
who
's
script
as
a
caricatur
of

i
've
been

thi

n't
offer
him
the
complex
of

and
``
the

--
essenti
hi
job
is

but
hi
voic
,
which
ha
a
richard

reson
textur
by
a
clint
eastwood
rasp
,
is
perfect
for
the
genr
.

the
late
oliv
reed
gave
us
the
best
work
of
hi
career
in
hi
last
role
.

i
hope
it
will
be
reward
with
an
oscar
.

my
onli
major
quibbl
with
``
gladiat
''
is
it
styliz
look
.

sever
scene
ar
tint
.

we
've
seen
a
lot
of
the
tint
look
late
,
particularli
in
``
payback
''
and
``
the
matrix
.
''

i
do
n't
get
the
appeal
of
the
style
,
which
make
featur
film
look
like
tv
ad
.

in
``
payback
''
it
wa
mere
annoi
,
but
in
``
gladiat
''
it
bleach
the
color
out
of
the
grand
spectacl
that
ar
the
raison
d'etr
of
the
roman
epic
.

-lrb-
perhap
it
's
meant
to
gloss
over
the
imperfect
of
the
comput-gener
shot
.
-rrb-

also
,
the
battl
scene
ar
film
in
a
strang
herki
jerki
style
that
seem
to
be
slo
mo
and
fast
forward
simultan
.

-lrb-
it
remind
me
of
the
wai
the
flash
run
in
the
comic
book
,
leav
a
half-blur
trail
of
imag
of
himself
behind
.
-rrb-

with
a
more
realist
look
,
``
gladiat
''
could
be
even
more
satisfi
than
``
braveheart
''
becaus
it
ha
a
tighter
script
and
a
more
fulfil
conclus
