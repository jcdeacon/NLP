``

rais
more
question
than
it
can
convincingli
answer
or
even
clearli
articul
.

it
subject
is
the
rise
threat
of
terror
in
american
citi
.

denzel

is
anthoni
``
hub
''
hubbard
,
who
run
the
fbi

,
whose
goe
by
both
``

''
and
``
sharon

''

as
the
terrorist
attack
continu
and
the
bodi
count
rise
,
the
question
of
martial
law
is
rais
.

who
oppos
martial
law
at
first
but
who
,
as
soon
as
the

decid
to
send
in
the

,
begin

into
a
prison
camp
and
attack
everi
link
that
hub
uncov
in
the
terrorist
chain
.

hub
listen
as
devereaux
tortur
and
murder
a
suspect
.

the
futur
zwick
and
screenwrit
lawrenc
wright
offer
is
all
too
possibl
.

what
would
happen
,
thei
ask
,
if
terror
becam
as
much
a
fact
of
daili
life
in
new
york
as
it
is
in
citi
like
beirut
and
belfast
?

what
would
happen
to
our
civil
liberti
if
soldier
patrol
our
street
with
machin
gun
?

these
question
``
the
sieg
''
answer
in
realist
detail
.

it
impli
tougher
on
,
though
:
what
can
be
done
to
combat
terror
without
sacrif
justic
and
freedom
?

if
we
encourag
terror
abroad
-lrb-
from
bene
's
charact
we
discov
that
the
cia
train
the
bomber
-rrb-
,
will
it
inevit
come
back
to
us
?

``
sieg
''
avoid
the
tougher
question
by
endow
it
hero
,
hub
,
with
a
uncompromis
sens
of
clear
right
and
wrong
.

thi
comfort
fantasi
of
sir
galahad
confront
the
evil
of
the
modern
world
is
an
escap
from
the
thought-provok
issu
the

.

still
,
zwick

credit
for
at

address
the
issu
with
as
much
