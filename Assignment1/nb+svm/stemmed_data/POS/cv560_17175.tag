oh
god
how
mani
john
grisham
lawyer
film
we
have
been
munund
with
!

in
a
perfect
world
,
``
a
civil
action
''
would
be
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.

it
's
cynic
about
lawyer
in
a
wai
that
grisham
is
n't
.

it
's
romant
in
the
exact
opposit
wai
a
grisham
book/film
is
n't
.

and
,
the
capper
,
it
ha
no
distinct
end
,
and
the
law
in
hollywood
film
is
that
abov
all
els
,
you
must
have
an
end
.

even
if
it
's
base
on
a
true
stori
,
a
true
stori
which
ha
n't
yet
end
,
you
must
suppli
an
end
,
a
fals
on
,
but
an
end
nevertheless
.

hell
,
``
a
civil
action
''
is
even
more
sly
and
more
witti
than
ani
of
the
grisham
work
put
togeth
-lrb-
and
that
includ
``
the
firm
,
''
the
onli
novel
of
hi
that
will
ever
be
regard
as
a
classic
-rrb-
.

yet
it
's
also
oddli
and
slightli
unsatisfi
.

weird
.

thi
is
,
in
fact
,
a
steve
zallian
film
,
not
just
the
work
of
a
hack
,
and
zallian
is
the
director
of
the
much-admir
``
search
for
bobbi
fischer
''
-lrb-
did
n't
see
it
-rrb-
and
writer
of
none
other
than
``
schindler
's
list
.
''

in
short
,
i
like
thi
gui
,
and
am
a
sucker
for
the
wai
he
tell
hi
stori
.

after
all
,
apart
from
the
obviou
it
's
-
a-holocaust-film
and
it
's
-
a-spielberg-film
,
is
n't
``
schindler
's
list
''
just
a
damn
brilliant
film
,
not
so
much
a
holocaust
film
as
it
is
a
wonder
charact
studi
.

``
a
civil
action
''
is
the
same
wai
:
it
's
narr
is
split
between
be
a
lawyer
film
and
be
a
charact
studi
.

and
it
's
here
that
the
film
seem
to
go
a
bit
wrong
.

the
main
complaint
of
thi
film
is
that
while
,
ye
,
it
's
an
engross
lawyerli
tale
,
it
ha
no
real
end
,
and
that
's
not
necessarili
the
problem
with
the
film
.

it
's
that
it
's
just
kind
of
unsatisfi
.

if
thi
were
a
great
film
,
it
would
feel
complet
,
and
still
end
basic
the
same
wai
.

but
thi
film
just
seem
to
end
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
be
stupid
and
suggest
an
altern
end
should
be
tack
on
:
imagin
,
if
you
will
,
be
on
of
those
the
film
is
about
,
look
forward
to
thi
film
,
and
then
discov
the
truth
ha
been
through
a
surrealist
and
unpleas
hollywood
filter
,
just
so
the
mani
wo
n't
bitch
about
what
is
,
essenti
,
genuin
.

but
the
fact
that
it
just
end
is
not
,
in
all
actual
,
what
is
wrong
with
it
.

it
's
rather
that
zallian
ha
chosen
,
in
the
last
half
hour
,
to
adandon
the
tradit
lawyer
stori
,
and
chose
the
other
part
of
hi
stori
,
the
on
about
the
lawyer
,
on
jan
schlictman
-lrb-
john
travolta
-rrb-
,
who
's
shown
in
the
open
and
throughout
most
of
the
movi
as
a
heartless
but
brilliant
lawyer
,
brilliant
becaus
he
's
manipul
and
he
alwai
win
.

it
wish
to
make
it
all
about
jan
in
the
end
,
but
the
truth
is
,
hi
chang
,
although
nice
done
,
is
not
full
.

we
see
him
suffer
from
a
person
crisi
,
and
travolta
doe
do
a
pretti
good
job
in
depict
hi
chang
of
heart
,
but
in
the
end
,
we
do
n't
fulli
believ
it
.

and
i
think
that
the
problem
is
when
he
ha
made
hi
decis
,
the
film
chose
an
odd
angl
to
go
at
,
a
nobl
on
,
but
on
that
give
the
film
's
conclus
that
of
incomplet
.

in
the
open
of
the
film
,
we
see
him
do
hi
old
schtick
,
manipul
court
,
win
case
effortlessli
,
and
then
discuss
on
a
heard
radio
interview
how
great
he
is
at
hi
job
and
how
much
he
care
for
hi
case
.

in
short
,
he
's
full
of
bullshit
and
we
know
it
.

in
the
film
,
he
take
a
case
that
is
hardli
desir
:
a
town
where
sever
of
the
children
have
di
mysteri
of
lukemia
and
the
sourc
of
the
ill
seem
to
be
from
a
local
factori
that
mai
or
mai
not
have
been
dump
wast
into
the
river
.

point
on
,
it
's
not

,
that

point

,
it

been

as
we

we
get
so
involv
in
the
wai
the

which

who
lost

who
begin
to
have
a
person
crisi
-rrb-
.

thing
begin
to
go
downhil
for
the
lawyer
in
the
second
half
,
as
thei
ar
up
against
imposs
odd
:
the
judg
-lrb-
john
lithgow
-rrb-
is
not
onli
a
strickler
,
but
a
pal
of
facher
;
the
employe
of
the
plant
ar
either
afraid
or
to
loyal
to
testifi
;
no
concret
evid
is
be
found
,
depsit
the
monei
spent
to
find
it
;
and
thei
ar
quickli
run
out
of
monei
.

as
maci
mortgag
everyth
he
can
,
includ
their
home
and
their
offic
,
he
slowli
lose
hi
saniti
-lrb-
hi
meatiest
role
sinc
,
oh
,
``
fargo
''
-rrb-
,
and
we
the
audienc
begin
to
feel
a
real
loss
of
hope
for
our
protagonist
.

in
fact
,
the
last
half
hour
is
such
a
chang
from
the
rest
of
the
film
and
so
unresolv
that
it
ha
been
wide
pan
as
not
be
up
to
par
-lrb-
owen
gleiberman
,
especi
,
critic
the
film
for
not
be
overli-dramat
...
i
suppos
like
a
grisham
novel
-rrb-
.

thi
would
n't
be
so
if
the
chang
in
jan
had
not
been
handl
the
wai
it
is
:
instead
of
have
a
chang
of
heart
and
automat
be
perceiv
as
good
,
he
's
seen
as
be
still
full
of
bullshit
.

becaus
he
doe
n't
take
stock
in
the
care
of
hi
partner
,
and
caus
them
all
to
lose
their
monei
and
noteriati
in
the
lawyer
field
becaus
he
want
to
help
the
peopl
of
the
town
,
he
is
instead
seen
as
be
of
good
natur
but
not
sure
how
to
bring
that
out
.

the
final
half
tri
to
redeem
thi
,
as
must
have
been
the
point
of
make
thi
in
zallian
's
mind
,
but
what
follow
is
a
seri
of
scene
where
we
mere
see
him
make
person
stand
for
hi
belief
,
and
though
he
ha
chang
consider
from
the
open
moment
when
he
's
seen
speed
back
and
forth
from
the
town
that
wish
to
emploi
him
-lrb-
and
thusli
receiv
two
speed
ticket
-rrb-
,
we
still
feel
that
the
big
chang
in
hi
life
is
that
he
's
not
rich
and
esteem
anymor
-lrb-
the
film
's
final
titl
card
is
witti
but
in
all
actual
shallow
-rrb-
.

the
fault
is
not
that
there
is
no
closur
to
the
court
case
-lrb-
it
's
still
go
on
,
you
know
-rrb-
,
but
that
it
person
stori
feel
like
it
need
either
anoth
chapter
or
anoth
angl
in
the
final
on
it
ha
.

we
need
to
feel
like
the
charact
ha
realli
made
a
big
chang
in
hi
life
,
and
that
the
stori
is
how
a
stori
of
strife
like
the
on
of
the
town
could
inspir
such
a
whop
chang
in
hi
person
life
.

it
onli
feel
like
half
of
that
.

mayb
even
less
.

and
it
's
not
travolta
,
who
doe
a
great
job
here
-lrb-
though
never
to
be
a
truli
memor
perform
of
hi
-rrb-
,
but
rather
zallian
,
whose
final
chapter
need
a
rewrit
.

up
to
then
,
though
,
it
's
an
engross
drama
,
on
of
the
best
of
the
year
in
fact
,
and
on
of
the
best
lawyer
film
,
period
.

the
reason
is
becaus
it
recogn
that
a
court
trial
is
not
about
those
be
defend
or
prosecut
,
but
rather
it
's
about
the
lawyer
,
the
knight
who
battl
eachoth
.

we
learn
that
the
compani
is
almost
posit
to
blame
for
the
death
in
the
town
,
but
the
reason
it
ca
n't
be
blame
is
becaus
it
ha
the
best
prosecut
you
can
find
.

and
duval
's
facher
is
such
a
brilliant
charact
and
he
doe
such
a
magnific
job
at
portrai
that
man
that
it
's
almost
easi
to
overlook
how
subtlei
great
he
is
.

facher
is
seen
as
an
elderli
man
,
a
goofi
eccentr
,
carri
a
broken
brown
bag
with
sticker
on
it
,
eat
lunch
out
of
paper
bag
,
and
make
a
point
to
take
time
out
of
hi
dai
to
listen
to
the
radio
,
and
scold
anyon
who
interupt
him
.

but
look
deeper
and
you
see
a
master
at
work
:
hi
evil
and
manipul
natur
ar
hidden
under
the
eccentr
that
other
don
upon
him
,
and
it
's
difficult
as
hell
to
clearli
gener
him
in
ani
wai
.

that
's
why
i
like
thi
film
:
it
's
hard
to
put
a
pointer
on
.

you
can
never
see
exactli
where
thi
film
will
land
,
and
even
when
the
credit
roll
,
you
still
ar
n't
sure
what
to
make
of
it
.

call
it
the
zallian
effect
.

same
thing
happen
with
``
schindler
's
list
''
-lrb-
not
that
i
'm
compar
oskar
schindler
to
jan
schlictman
-rrb-
.

each
film
is
so
greatli
craft
that
you
ca
n't
help
but
get
involv
in
it
broad
storytel
,
interest
charact
,
and
,
most
peculiarli
,
the
wit
that
come
along
with
it
.

if
onli
it
felt
total
complet
-lrb-
like
,
sai
,
``
schindler
's
list
,
''
though
at
thi
point
it
mai
be
unfair
to
make
comparison
between
the
two
-rrb-
,
it
might
have
been
on
of
the
best
film
of
the
year
,
and
along
with
that
,
a
full
breath
of
fresh
air
.
