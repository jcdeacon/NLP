but
befor

,
he
first
ha
to
go
through
a
cliff
note
version
of
georg
bailei

-lrb-
mitchel
-rrb-
lose
$
8,000
of
the
bank

monei
.

without
the
monei
,
the
bank
must
close
down
.

georg
is
stuck
in
a
tremend
bind
,
and
contempl
suicid
.

clarenc
,
the
faith
servant
,
is
there
just
to
pick
him
up
,
and
to
show
him
what
bedford
would
be
like
without
georg
.

thi
is
all
a
lead-in
to
the
veri
famou
last
scene
,
where
georg
final
see
what
true
happi
is
about
.

it
's
a
wonder
life
doe
have
it
fault
.

the
movi
is
begin
to
feel
date
in
the
detail
,
especi
in
the
treatment
of
women
and
men
.

the
sex
role
in
the
film
ar
weirdli
out
of
place
in
the
90
's
,
like
someth
out
of
a
revisionist
look
.

all
the
men
drink
too
much
and
slap
their
wive
too
much
dure
some
portion
of
the
film
.

there
ar
,
howev
,
endear
moment
in
all
of
thi
.

capra
put
in
just
enough
humor
mock
the
sex
role
of
the
50
's
to
make
the
movi
remark
enjoy
.

the
stori
is
hacknei
,
and
the
end
feel
,
well
,
a
littl
too
sugarish
.

there
's
thi
uneasi
feel
of
sugar
over
everyth
,
especi
the
sequenc
where
georg
is
either
in
troubl
,
or
help
somebodi
.

it
's
a
littl
too
nice
for
my
like
,
at
time
.

there
is
,
howev
,
enough
humor
,
enough
wit
,
and
enough
of
jimmi
stewart
to
get
the
movi
through
the
middl
part
,
which
would
be
the
most
difficult
.

but
watch
it
's
a
wonder
life
is
never
bore
or
difficult
:
it
's
alwai
interest
,
right
until
the
final
,
which
,
for
all
it
sugar
,
make
delight
sens
and
is
beautifulli
done
.

capra
doe
have
hi
monument
clich
,
but
the
actor
relish
them
and
overplai
everyth
to
perfect
.

donna
reed
is
perfect
as
the
love
,
obeidi
wife
,
and
lionel
barrymor
is
glorious
grump
as
mr.
potter
.

everyon
els
is
magnific
,
includ
bert
and
erni
-lrb-
ward
bond
and
frank
faylen
-rrb-
.

there
is
a
gener
sens
of
good
,
as
if
everyon
in
the
film
know
that
thei
ar
make
a
great
film
,
and
thei
relish
that
.

stewart
,
howev
,
is
the
king
of
all
of
thi
.

he
is
sometim
awkward
,
especi
when
sai
``
merri
christma
''
to
all
object
,
anim
or
inanim
.

but
he
is
jame
stewart
,
and
he
's
lovabl
delight
throughout
the
film
.

have
i
complain
?

i
should
n't
have
.

thi
is
a
realli
good
movi
.

no
,
thi
is
a
great
movi
.

better
yet
,
thi
is
a
phenomen
movi
.

there
is
a
reason
classic
ar
invent
:
to
make
sure
that
peopl
will
alwai
have
great
movi
to
aid
them
in
their
quest
for
live
life
.

thi
is
on
of
those
film
.

it
is
a
``
feel-good
''
movi
,
someth
peopl
complain
a
littl
too
much
about
.

but
capra
's
rework
of
``
a
christma
carol
''
is
the
greatest
christma
movi
of
all
time
.

there
,
i
've
said
it
.

i
have
to
admit
,
the
first
time
i
saw
thi
,
i
saw
it
with
my
famili
,
includ
myyear
old
kid
sister
.

thei
all
love
it
.

thei
love
georg
,
hi
wife
,
hi
troubl
,
and
the
beauti
end
.

is
it
a
littl
too
sugar-coat
?

mayb
.

no
matter
.

thi
is
a
film
that
should
be
watch
time
and
time
again
,
with
famili
around
a
coffe
tabl
,
and
eggnog
on
the
plate
.

it
is
a
film
that
just
make
you
feel
good
about
life
,
famili
,
and
hope
.

it
is
the
perfect
christma
film
,
flaw
and
all
.

it
is
frank
capra
's
greatest
acheiv
,
and
that
realli
doe
sai
a
lot
.

for
about
121
out
of
129
minut
,
thi
movi
is
flawless
.

the
rest
can
be
excus
:
no
film
is
perfectli
flawless
.

i
ca
n't
get
over
how
much
i
love
thi
movi
,
and
how
much
you
will
,
after
watch
it
,
digest
it
,
and
sit
with
your
famili
,
appreci
how
special
life
realli
is
.
