some
critic
,
includ
siskel
&
ebert
,
ar
on
the
record
state
that
martin
scorses
's
rage
bull
,
the
stori
of
boxer
jake
la
motta
,
is
the
best
film
of
the
'80s
.

sinc
there
ar
still
a
number
of
'80s
film
that
i
have
n't
seen
,
i
do
n't
feel
qualifi
to
make
such
a
judgment
,
but
i
'll
sai
thi
without
hesit
:
rage
bull
is
a
great
motion
pictur
,
and
i
would
be
surpris
if
more
than
a
hand
of
film
releas
between
januari
1
,
1980
and
decemb
31
,
1989
come
close
to
it
level
.

bio-pic
often
fall
into
on
of
two
categori
:
overblown
hero-worship
or
a
dry

dull
textbook
account
.

it
's
rare
that
a
movi
with
the
monik
``
base
on
the
life
of

come
across
as
anyth
more
than
sporad
energet

entertain
.

rage
bull
is
the
perfect
counterexampl
,
and
a
brilliant
argument
for
film
maker
to
continu
to

in
thi
genr
.

the

at

we

thi
is

the
choic
is

give
rage

a

in
an
era
when
a
black-and-white

is
almost
unheard
of
.

-lrb-
on

of

reason
that

in

-lrb-

consid
scorses
's
choic
of
shot
and
us
of
slow

-rrb-
,
the
violenc
is
stark
and
disturb

there
's
no

in

the

also
us
a

of
point-of-view
shot
design
to
show
the
world
,
howev
briefli
,
from
la
motta
's
perspect
.

scorses
could
have
chosen
to
end
the
film
with
la
motta
's
loss
to
sugar
rai
,
where
he
surrend
hi
middleweight
crown
.

after
that
,
hi
career
wa
all
downhil
.

yet
the
director
allow
the
film
to
run
for
thirti
minut
after
thi
pivot
moment
,
stretch
more
than
a
decad
into
la
motta
's
futur
.

the
reason
is
obviou
:
scorses
is
n't
as
interest
in
box
as
he
is
in
the
charact
.

follow
hi
retir
,
la
motta
is
still
as
violent
and
volatil
as
ever
,
but
he
ha
lost
the
arena
in
which
he
can
legal
unleash
those
tendenc
.

we
see
the
result
of
thi
beast
let
loos
on

and
how
the
consequ
of
hi
action
reduc
him
to
a
parodi
of
hi
former
self

who
can
not
feel
a
surg
of
piti
for
la
motta
as
he
quietli

-lrb-
``

perhap

it
