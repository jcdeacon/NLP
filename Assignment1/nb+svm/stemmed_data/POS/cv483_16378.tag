earlier
thi
year
,
the
movi
holi
man
open
to
a
meager
box
offic
receipt
and
to
indiffer
from
audienc
and
critic
.

a
real
charmer
of
a
movi
,
it
's
possibl
that
the
subject
matter
wa
too
hip
or
trendi
to
attract
ani
real
audienc
.

now
,
at
the
end
of
1998
,
come
wake
ned
devin
,
a
comedi
which
inspir
the
same
vein
of
easygo
laughter
.

there
's
no
substanti
differ
between
the
two
other
than
a
more
refin
atmospher
--
thei
strike
all
the
same
chord
--
but
still
,
ned
devin
is
a
movi
worth
see
.

the
plot
is
interest
and
robust
:
the
latest
lotteri
winner
is
ned
devin
-lrb-
jimmi
keogh
-rrb-
,
of
tullymor
,
ireland
.

ned
's
prize
is
over
six
million
pound
,
but
the
shock
of
win
kill
the
poor
old
man
,
and
the
check
remain
unclaim
.

enter
jacki
o'shea
-lrb-
ian
bannen
-rrb-
and
michael
o'sullivan
-lrb-
david
kelli
-rrb-
,
the
onli
two
resid
who
ar
awar
the
winner
is
in
their
villag
.

the
two
men
eventu
find
the
ticket
,
and
decid
that
if
michael
can
convinc
the
lotto
author
that
he
's
actual
ned
,
the
entir
town
can
reap
the
benefit
;
their
onli
adversari
is
an
ancient
old
woman
-lrb-
eileen
dromei
-rrb-
who
see
more
profit
in
report
the
fraud
.

ian
bannen
and
david
kelli
truli
shine
as
jacki
and
michael
.

jacki
,
stocki
and
larg
,
is
the
brain
behind
the
oper
;
michael
,
scrawni
and
short
,
is
the
method
man
.

the
two
contrast
each
other
delightfulli
,
and
at
the
same
time
remain
sympathet
to
the
audienc
.

everi
viewer
is
sure
to
like
both
of
them
.

there
ar
other
minor
subplot
includ
as
well
,
such
as
an
unlik
romanc
between
a
local
girl
and
the
town
pig
farmer
.

thi
appear
quit
inconsequenti
until
the
end
,
and
even
with
a
startl
revel
it
's
a
tad
bit
unnecessari
.

overal
,
wake
ned
devin
ha
a
predict
outcom
,
and
plot
twist
ar
never
realli
taken
serious
.

the
end
,
a
veri
hilari
and
veri
iron
twist
of
fate
,
somehow
fit
with
the
twist
sens
of
humor
the
movi
exhibit
throughout
.

the
kirk
jone
script
is
inde
off-the-cuff
.

in
a
wai
,
wake
ned
devin
is
exactli
like
the
class
of
peopl
it
present
:
warm
,
friendli
,
outgo
,
and
jovial
.

it
's
the
perfect
kind
of
comedi
,
a
real
gem
of
a
tale
that
set
up
a
trivial
plot
outlin
by
which
to
introduc
a
sympathet
cast
of
charact
and
a
string
of
joke
.

there
's
noth
remot
seriou
or
ground
for
more
than
a
moment
or
two
,
becaus
the
spirit
of
ned
devin
is
a
lightheart
on
.

inde
,
it
's
on
of
the
year
's
best
feel-good
movi
--
91
minut
of
unrestrain
joi
that
no
on
should
miss
.
