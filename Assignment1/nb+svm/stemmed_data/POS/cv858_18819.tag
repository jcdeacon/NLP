take
for

,
scott

go
on
the
jerri
springer
show
complain
about
how
evil
hi
father
is

the
wai
austin
power
:
tswsm
us
it
humor
is
clever
,
throw
a
hilari
scene
at
you
,
follow
by
five
minut
of
on
liner
,
follow
by
anoth
outrag
scene
,
so
you
never
stop
laugh
.

there
wa
honestli
not
on
moment
in
austin
power
:
tswsm
where
i
wa
n't
laugh
.

the
last
film
that
i
laugh
so
hard
in
,
wa
well
,
austin
power
!

it
is
appar
that
mike
myer
knew
how
funni
thi
film
wa
while
write
it
.

the
film
even
make
fun
of
itself
in
a
line
,
someth
along
the
line
of
,
``
it
's
funni
how
england
and
southern
california
look
noth
alik
.
''

tswsm
wa
film
in
southern
california
,
but
wa
suppos
to
take
place
in
england
.

i
can
tell
you
on
thing-he
is
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
thi
enorm
popular
charact
,
which
is
all
over
televis
,
newspap
,
magazin
,
and
the
movi
theater
.

i
believ
that
dr.
evil
got
more
attent
in
the
tswsm
than
austin
power
did
.

dr.
evil
provid
more
laugh
,
more
memor
moment
,
and
more
interest
dialogu
than
austin
did
thi
time
around
,
who
seem
to
miss
the
funni
touch
that
he
had
in
the
first
film
.

i
felt
that
austin
realli
did
have
hi
mojo
taken
awai
,
but
from
screenplai
writer
mike
myer
,
not
fat
bastard
.

also
make
a
great
addit
to
the
seri
is
mini
me
,
who
is
plai
by
vern
troyer
.

even
though
the
midget
actor
isyear
old
,
he
is
ador
by
dr.
evil
's
side
constantli
.

the
first
austin
power
film
had
bare
ani
sentiment
qualiti
,
such
as
lack
of
charact
develop
,
bare
ani
detail
plot
characterist
,
and
bare
ani
good
act
,
but
austin
power
tswsm
actual
show
some
qualiti
behind
the
frequent
humor
.

mike
myer
,
with
hi
three
role
,
act
as
eddi
murphi
did
in
the
nutti
professor
,
disguis
himself
complet
in
on
of
the
role
.

-lrb-
fat
bastard
-rrb-
all
three
charact
ar
differ
,
and
mike
myer
doe
do
a
good
job
handl
each
on
of
them
.

heather
graham
made
a
great
addit
with
her
talent
to
tswsm
,
and
doe
a
much
better
job
than
elizabeth
hurlei
did
,
who
gave
a
veri
flat
perform
in
the
origin
,
speak
her
line
without
ani
feel
or
emot
.

speak
of
hurlei
,
she
can
be
seen
in
tswsm
for
a
few
brief
moment
.

hopefulli
,
graham
tag
along
for
futur
austin
power
adventur
.

the
bottom
line-a
groovi
sequel
that
mike
myer
put
all
of
hi
mojo
into
write
