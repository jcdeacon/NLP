almost
a

ryan
ask
whether
a
film
could
be
both
``
anti
war
''
and
``
pro-soldier
''
,
john
irvin
's
hamburg
hill
prove
it
could
.

lost
in
the
inund
of
critic
acclaim
that
greet
oliv
stone
's
platoon
,
thi
excel
film
wa
dismiss
as
``
too
militarist
''
.

it
's
hard
to
understand
exactli
why
--
unless
irvin
,
in
assembl
hi
motlei
collect
of
young
men
who
for
predict
-lrb-
and
often
naiv
-rrb-
reason
``
chose
to
show
up

for
the
vietnam
debacl
,
--
ha
refus
to
present
us
with
the
stone
killer
,
drug-stoke
psycho
and
ruthless
opportunist
who
have
becom
to
vietnam

epic
what
``

.

hamburg
hill
,
base
on
a
true
stori
,
is
not
an
easi
film
to
watch
.

there
is
a
scene
that
will
have
grai
anti-war
activist
squirm
in
their
seat
,
or
move
to
genuin
tear
.

and
the
climact
final
assault
on
the
``
hill
''
in
question
is
visual
confus
.

gristli
realiti
ar
present
in
brief
flash
,
as
if
the
brain
dare
not
acknowledg
what
it

and
in

and
white
,
becom
almost
indistinguish
from
each
other
,
as
thei
do
in
the
chao
of
actual
combat
.

the
act
throughout
is
solid
with
an
absolut
stellar
perform
render
by
courtnei

in
a

that
will

if

you
ow
