the
coen
brother
ar
back
again
,
thi
time
with
homer
's
``
odyssei
''
as
the
backdrop
in
their
tale
of
three
fugit
from
a
mississippi
chain
gang
who
trek
across
the
south
to
find
a
secret
treasur
in
``
o
brother
,
where
art
thou
?
''

right
for
the
begin
of
``
o
brother
''
the
coen
grab
your
attent
with
a
chain
gang
of
prison
inmat
break
rock
along
the
road
in
unison
to
a
work
song
.

the
camera
flow
around
the
hard
toil
men
,
give
a
visual
excit
symmetri
to
the
scene
that
end
with
our
three
hero-ulyss
everett
mcgill
-lrb-
georg
cloonei
-rrb-
,
delmar
-lrb-
tim
blake
nelson
-rrb-
and
pete
-lrb-
john
turturro
-rrb-
-
escap
across
a
cotton
field
.

it
is
the
begin
of
a
journei
that
take
on
differ
mean
and
urgenc
to
each
member
of
the
trio
.

a
strong
suit
,
as
alwai
with
the
coen
brother
,
is
the
depth
of
charact
of
the
folk
thei
creat
in
their
film
.

their
charact
ar
goofi
and
comic
,
like
nicola
cage
in
``
rais
arizona
''
;
or
,
dramat
,
as
albert
finnei
and
john
turturro
in
``
miller
's
cross
''
;
and
,
even
a
mix
of
the
two
with
franc
mcdormand
in
``
fargo
.
''

in
all
case
,
and
in
``
o
brother
,
''
too
,
the
charact
popul
their
film
ar
three-dimension
peopl
.

ulyss
everett
is
a
handsom
,
hair-obsess
petti
crimin
with
a
silver
tongu
and
not
a
lot
in
the
brain
depart
.

but
,
he
seem
like
a
geniu
when
compar
to
the
simpl
,
sweet
delmar
and
the
maladjust
pete
,
who
follow
their
self
appoint
leader
to
a
promis
treasur
of
$
1.2
million
.

their
odyssei
take
on
the
mystic
proport
of
homer
's
origin
materi
as
thei
meet
all
manner
of
peopl
along
the
wai
,
includ
those
danger
siren
who
beckon
them
onto
symbol
rocki
shoal
and
a
cyclop
who
beat
them
and
take
all
their
monei
.

there
is
magic
,
too
,
when
delmar
believ
that
pete
wa
turn
into
a
horni
toad
by
the
siren
.

the
stori
meander
through
the
differ
vignett
of
the
boi
'
adventur
,
give
the
flick
a
choppi
,
episod
feel
that
disrupt
the
overal
flow
.

some
of
the
interlud
ar
an
epiphani
,
though
.

the
trio
becom
a
quartet
when
thei
pick
up
guitar-plai
tommi
johnson
-lrb-
chri
thoma
king
-rrb-
and
visit
a
radio
station
in
the
middl
of
nowher
,
run
by
it
blind
owner
-lrb-
stephen
root
-rrb-
.

thei
becom
the
soggi
bottom
boi
for
the
sightless
radio
station
man
and
,
without
their
knowledg
,
ar
record
as
thei
sing
the
tradit
tune
,
``
i
am
a
man
of
constant
sorrow
.
''

it
is
a
wonder
moment
of
moviemak
and
give
us
,
in
my
mind
,
the
best
movi
song
of
the
year
.

contrast
thi
and
other
wonder
moment
-lrb-
the
sexi
seduct
by
the
siren
come
to
mind
-rrb-
ar
some
pretenti
bit
that
detract
from
the
overal
qualiti
of
``
o
brother
.
''

in
particular
,
near
the
end
,
is
a
scene
where
ulyss
,
delmar
and
pete
crash
a
ku
klux
klan
ralli
to
save
tommi
from
be
lynch
.

the
scene
is
overblown
and
flashi
and
reek
of
``
the
wizard
of
oz
.
''

thei
do
n't
sai
``
lion

oh
