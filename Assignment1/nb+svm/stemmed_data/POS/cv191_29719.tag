i
must
admit
i
'm
go
to
be
a
bit
bias
in
my
review
of
the
new
romant
comedi
serendip
,
becaus
that
also
defin
how
i
met
my
current
girlfriend
.

the
magic
and
mysteri
of
our
fate
encount
is
also
embodi
in
the
quirki
and
fresh
of
the
veri
funni
and
veri
romant
serendip
.

i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
romant
comedi
genr
,
but
someth
drew
me
to
thi
film
.

mayb
it
wa
the
cast
of
the
underr
jeremi
piven
in
a
support
role
,
and
the
hilari
eugen
levi
.

mayb
it
wa
my
hope
that
john
cusack
would
get
the
redempt
he
justli
deserv
after
such
crap
as
high
fidel
,
con
air
,
and
push
tin
.

but
mayb
it
wa
becaus
i
feel
as
giddi
as
a
school
kid
right
now
with
thi
whole
romant
thing
current
in
my
life
.

the
stori
of
serendip
is
simpl
.

two
peopl
,
john
trager
-lrb-
john
cusack
-rrb-
and
sara
thoma
-lrb-
kate
beckinsal
,
look
ever
so
hot
-rrb-
,
have
a
chanc
encount
over
a
pair
of
glove
--
with
buck
henri
smack
dab
in
the
middl
.

charm
beyond
repair
,
these
two
knucklehead
grab
a
sunda
togeth
at
a
caf√©
call
serendip
,
talk
about
that
irrespons
thing
call
fate
and
the
avenu
it
lead
peopl
down
,
and
spend
a
few
hour
at
the
local
ic
skate
rink
.

but
with
each
of
them
alreadi
involv
with
other
parti
,
sara
ha
john
write
hi
name
and
number
on
a
$
5
bill
and
she
write
her
name
and
number
on
a
copi
of
love
in
the
time
of
cholera
.

sara
declar
that
if
thi
``
thing
''
--
let
's
just
call
it
love
--
is
destin
to
happen
,
fate
will
bring
them
togeth
in
the
futur
.

year
later
and
on
opposit
coast
of
america
,
john
and
sara
--
both
engag
but
still
unsur
whether
thei
have
found
their
soul
mate
--
decid
to
seek
each
other
out
to
rest
their
doubt
.

what
happen
then
is
an
enjoy
and
often
hilari
cat-and-mous
game
with
the
fate-involv
such
item
as
mistaken
ident
,
a
graduat
homag
,
john
corbett
as
a
freaki
new
ag
musician
,
and
eugen
levi
as
an
irat
and
craze
salesman
--
to
find
out
if
that
``
thing
''
wa
right
after
all
.
