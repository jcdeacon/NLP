,
othello

feroci
intens
by
martin
sheen-shower
more
love
and
concern
on
hi
star
player
than
on

the
script
follow
the
familiar
line
of
the
classic
.

hugo

it
all
end
in

which
is
why
the

distrust
of
those
he
love

and
the
eros

hartnett
is
appropri
cool
and
machiavellian
as
he
weav
hi
deadli
web
of
li
and
deceit
,
turn
friend
against

and
lover
against

,
but
occasion
also
rise
to
the
occas

move
from
ador
to
confus
to
fear
of
her

the
film
doe
contain
a
few
misstep
:
a
