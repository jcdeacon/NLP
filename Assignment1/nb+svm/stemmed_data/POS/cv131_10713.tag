sever

turn
in

jude
and
sue
do
do
some
nasti

-lrb-
an
interest
scene
,
to
sai
the

...
-rrb-
,
and
ar
soon
born
into
a
controversi
non-wedlock
,
as
she
eventu
give
birth
to
their
babi
,
and
jude
inherit
hi
son
from
arabella
,
who
turn
up
again
after
awhil
.

becaus
thei
ar
n't
marri
,
and
becaus
thei
're
cousin
,
thei
run
into
problem
with
everi
place
thei
go
to
,
carri
around
two
children
everywher
,
and
onli
stai
in
lodg
for
a
veri
brief
period
of
time
,
then
move
on
.

if
you
did
n't
think
thi
wa
harsh
enough
,
wait
till
you
see
what
happen
later
on
...
the
sad
truth
is
that
jude
is
on
of
the
miser
peopl
who
can
never
get
ani
luck
in
thi
world
.

he
will
never
gain
ani
true
happi
,
and
ani
happi
that
happen
to
him
will
be
fleet
,
and
will
probabl
bring
more
horribl
instanc
to
hi
life
.

part
of
it
is
hi
fault-he
's
too
optimist
,
and
too
gullibl
.

but
societi
ha
a
wai
of
take
these
peopl
,
and
hurt
them
until
their
death
.

the
end
of
``
jude
''
is
bleak
becaus
it
ha
to
be
-lrb-
although
i
hear
the
end
of
the
novel
is
even
wors-guess
i
'll
have
to
read
it
now
-rrb-
.

``
jude
''
offer
a
satir
view
on
societi
's
cruelti
,
but
show
no
wai
of
cure
thi
,
and
thank
heaven
it
doe
n't
.

there
's
no
wai
to
relinquish
the
selfish
of
societi
,
and
ani
solut
would
be
too
small
to
cure
such
a
mass
problem
.

satir
ha
alwai
been
on
of
the
few
wai
of
chang
certain
peopl
's
mind
,
and
that
's
what
``
jude
''
is
.

sure
,
it
's
on
hell
of
a
downer
,
but
it
need
to
be
.

the
film
also
posess
two
fantast
perform
from
it
two
lead
,
and
some
good
support
work
along
with
it
.

christoph
eccleston
-lrb-
slightli
resembl
richard
edson
with
hi
new
look
and
dumb
express
-rrb-
plai
jude
wonderfulli
,
sometim
bring
a
big
dumb
smile
to
hi
face
,
and
make
him
kind
of
child-like
at
other
time
.

kate
winslet
,
in
a
pre
-
``
titan
''
perform
,
is
brilliant
,
nail
everi
psych
of
her
charact
,
and
creat
someon
who
's
troubl
but
veri
seduct
with
her
person
.

kate
mai
be
the
best
actress
in
her
ag
group
-lrb-
if
you
do
n't
believ
me
,
see
``
titan
,
''
branagh
's
``
hamlet
,
''
``
sens
and
sensibl
,
''
and
``
heavenli
creatur
,
''
the
latter
on
be
my
favorit
perform
of
her
-rrb-
.

in
the
support
role
,
liam
cunningham
is
a
wonderfulli
flaw
teacher
,
expos
all
hi
bad
part
,
but
ultim
be
a
pretti
good
person
;
and
rachel
griffith
is
wonderfulli
immatur
as
jude
's
wife
,
whom
he
never
divorc
.

``
jude
''
move
at
a
veri
slow
pace
,
and
keep
taunt
it
viewer
with
chanc
of
happi
for
it
protagonist
,
which
would
drive
some
peopl
nut
.

but
those
who
appreci
good
social
commentari
with
their
film
,
no
matter
how
slow
or
downright
depress
thei
ar
-lrb-
thi
on
is
both
-rrb-
will
appreci
``
jude
,
''
though
i
doubt
anyon
truli
enjoi
it
.
