line
of

li
wa
explain
the
whole
``
kiss
of
the
dragon
''
thing
to
him
and
he
cut
him
off
by
sai
``

my
ass
!
''

pure
action
movi
poetri
.

anywai
,
other
than
him
,
jet
li
also
handl
hi
``
act
''
pretti
well
in
thi
film
,
with
veri
littl
real
dialogu
to
sai
,
but
enough
to
make
us
believ
hi
charact
.

actual
,
just
look
into
the
man
's
ey
gener
tell
you
a
lot
.

fonda
wa
also
pretti
good
,
despit
plai
on
of
the
most
trashi
and
abus
women
that
i
have
seen
in
quit
some
time
,
but
i
still
felt
kinda
bad
for
her
,
so
i
guess
she
did
her
job
okai
.

but
in
the
end
,
nobodi
goe
to
see
thi
kind
of
movi
for
oscar
perform
.

we
go
to
see
jet
li
movi
becaus
we
want
to
see
jet
li
kick
a
lot
of
ass
from
side
to
side
,
and
thi
film
deliv
gangbust
on
that
front
.

and
ye
...
thei
have
no
wire-fu
in
thi
movi
...
i
sai
again
...
no
wire-work
,
no
bullshit
stunt
with
li
float
around
in
mid-air
for
over
a
minut
.

it
's
all
straight
action
,
fist
to
fist
,
boot
to
face
and
all
around
cool
stunt
.

if
that
's
what
you
're
look
for
,
i
do
n't
see
how
you
will
be
disappoint
with
thi
film
.

ye
,
it
's
not
veri
origin
in
plot
-lrb-
just
take
luc
besson
's
own
la
femm
nikita
and
mix
in
plenti
of
hi
own
the
profession
et
voila
!
-rrb-

,
doe
have
an
annoi
hip-hoppi
soundtrack
that
just
got
on
my
nerv
after
a
while
-lrb-
i
also
would
have
gotten
rid
of
the
whole
acupunctur
thang
...
-rrb-
and
will
have
anyon
not
will
to
restrain
their
disbelief
,
roll
their
ey
all
over
the
place
.

but
wa
i
entertain
?

thoroughli
.

doe
the
film
featur
more
gunplai
,
martial
art
and
over-the-top
kill
that
most
recent
action
flick
?

ye
,
again
.

doe
thi
sound
interest
to
you
?

well
,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
entir
up
to
you
.

on
thing
that
i
would
definit
recommend
is
,
as
jet
li
point
out
himself
on
hi
websit
,
that
you
leav
the
kid
at
home
for
thi
on
.

in
fact
,
you
might
even
wan
na
leav
yourself
if
you
ca
n't
handl
the
more
violent
of
sequenc
.

all
in
all
