made
into
an
immort
a
centuri
and
a
half
ago
by
the
sinist
ethan
blake
,
she
continu
to
allevi
boredom
with
her
state
of
be
.

so
,
what
's
an
undead
girl
to
do
,
except
squeez
into
the
tightest
fit
cloth
possibl
,
get
out

seduc
a

,
and
kill
a
few
peopl
for
monei
and

thi

yet
somehow
,
it
is

with

buxom

still
,
it
is
consid
to
be
on
of
the
finest
british
vampir
film
.

agre
,
it
might
be
,
but
is
far
from
be
the
best
vampir
flick
ever
.

period
.

razor
blade
smile
ha
some
rather
high
product
valu
,
shown
by
the
nice
overal
tone
to
the
film
.

the
film
is
also
a
bit
of
a
departur
from
popular
vampir
lore
,
with
a
vampir
that
can
go
out
in
broad
daylight
without
disintegr
,
doe
n't
sleep
in
a
coffin
-lrb-
but
leav
on
next
to
her
comput
-rrb-
,
and
see
religion
as
the
`
opium
of
the
peopl

-lrb-
henc
,
immun
to

but
asid
from
that
,
it
doe
n't
strai
too

from

that

liter
goe
for
the
throat
,
then
pump
the
wound
full
of
process
chees
.

you
ca
n't
help
but
laugh
when
a
femal
vampir
get
decapit
and
her
sever
head
goe
fly
into
a
puddl
.

you
'll
laugh
even
harder
at
the
hideous
contriv
situat
-lrb-
to
distract
two
femal
guard
,
lilith
toss
a
cellular
phone
toward
them
and
dial

you
'll
laugh
the
hardest
when
a
murder

recant
the
tale
and
suddenli
start
sob
uncontrol

and
then
,
there
's
the
sudden
twist
end
-lrb-
i
have
enough
heart
not
to
give
it

-rrb-
.

the
film
refus
to
take
itself
serious
,
which
is
a
good
thing
,
as
by
the
time
lilith
zip
up
her
skin-tight
bodi
suit
and
then
unzip
it
just
to
show
the
right
amount
of
cleavag
,
you
've
most
like
forgotten
the
main
point
of
the
stori
.

but
in
case
you
realli
care
,
she
's
been
assign
to
kill
a
bunch
of
peopl
who
belong
to
the
so-call
illuminati
,
and
she
's
leav
a
huge
mess
behind
for
the
polic
to
find
.

as
much
as
my
critic
,
thi
movi
work
best
as
a
guilti
pleasur
or
as
a
film
that
you
watch
with
your
friend
and
within
group
.

almost
destin
for

,
the

while
thi
mai
not

be
the
film
you

want

watch
by
yourself
,
it
make
for
