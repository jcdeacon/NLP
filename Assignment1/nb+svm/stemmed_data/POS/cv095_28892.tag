hernandez
-rrb-
take
a
two-hour
bu
ride
in
order

an

athlet
,
carlo
is
respons
,
modest
and
focus
as
he
work
on
secur
a

in
the
naval
academi

all
is

the

of

nicol

hell-bent
on

carlo
is
smart
enough

recogn
the
danger
in
get
involv

he
is
onli
human
and
she
ha
the

plu
,
as

note

she
ha
a

for
draw

-lrb-
god
,
how
i
hate
lower-case
titl
-rrb-
take
situat
that
look
stale
on
paper
and
make
them
seem
fresh
.

while
note
the
racial

social
differ
between
the

the
screenplai
danc
around
most
of

ar
still

-rrb-
.

the
filmmak
make
a
point
to
give
charact
that
crucial
extra
bit
of
shade
that
turn
them
into
individu
instead
of
stereotyp
and
the
actor
take
it
from
there
.

cute-as-a-button
dunst
forc
the
viewer
to
share
the
pain
beneath
nicol
's
behavior
.

she
is
credibl
enough
that
when
dad
urg
carlo
to
get
awai
from
her
befor
she
drag
him
down
,
i
hope
the
boi
would
listen
.

as
carlo
,
hernandez
is
a
revel
.

hunki
without
look
like
the
product
of
a
hollywood
design
team
,
the
young
man
can
realli
act
;
we
will
see
a
lot
of
thi
gui
in
the
futur
.

asid
from
it
titl
,
the
biggest
problem
with
``
crazi/beauti
''
is
it
end
,
which
wrap
everyth
up
too
fast
and
too
tidi
.

after
carefulli
present
credibl
charact
and
situat
,
the
conclus
feel
rush
and
lazi
.

still
,
thi
is
the
kind
of
film
that
deserv
accolad
from
critic
instead
of
cheap
shot
.

``
afterschool
special
''
my
ass
``
crazi/beauti
''
is
the
real
deal
.
