instead

he
ask

as
in

,
demm
quickli
establish
that
the
horror
of
the
stori
will
not
come
from
the
fact
of
the
ghost
itself
,
but
from
the
terrifi

in
which
the

wa
creat
.

seth
is
the
on
be
haunt
,
but
the
ghost
in
the

is
the
least

her
fear
.

in

,
the
ghost
is
on

it

thi

morrison

unlik

a

be
put
down

allow

the

taken
