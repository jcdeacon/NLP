doe
it
?

in
chad
,
writer/director
labut
and
actor
eckhart
have
creat
on
of
the
most
chill
monster
ever
commit
to
film-hannib
lector
mai
eat
human
flesh
,
but
chad
is
an
eater
of
soul
.

hi
evil
is
as
subtl
as
a
viper
's
,
and
as
easi
as
hi
smile
.

we
watch
in
stun
disbelief
as
he
back-stab
cowork
,
humili
hi
subordin
,
and
work
hi
deadli
venom
into
christin
's
heart
.

hi
charact
would
be
a
joke
if
he
wa
n't
so
chillingli
real-all
of
us
have
work
with
a
chad
,
and
some
of
us
mai
be
him
.

he
's
the
gui
who
take
your
job
and
then
laugh
at
you
for
your
weak
.

if
on
of
hi
co-worker
should
happen
to
go
postal
and
walk
into
the
offic
with
a
bag
full
of
handgun
,
he
had
best
have
hi
escap
rout
clearli
in
mind
.

polit
is
hi
game
,
and
the
modern
cubicl-fill
offic
is
hi
playground
.

men
wear
the
guis
of
a
black
comedi
,
but
it
function
best
as
allegori
.

the
most
controversi
moment
in
the
film
happen
when
chad
humili
a
black
temp
by
ask
him
how
badli
he
want
to
succe
in
the
compani
,
then
forc
him
to
prove
it
in
a
manner
i
wo
n't
describ
.

the
scene
is
charg
with
racism
and
fraught
with
peril
.

could
it
happen
in
the
real
world
?

probabl
not
.

taken
as
allegori
,
howev
,
it
is
repres
of
the
treatment
of
the
meek
by
the
power
in
all
facet
of
societi
.

mayb
it
's
just
the
english
major
in
me
,
but
chad
,
in
hi
motiveless
cruelti
toward
christin
and
hi
care
manipul
of
howard
,
can
be
seen
as
a
symbol
of
unbridl
capit
,
of
greed
without
conscienc
.

the
entir
film
is
a
metaphor
for
social
darwin-onli
the
strong
will
surviv
.

the
marvel
of
labut
's
multi-layer
script
is
that
it
can
disturb
each
member
of
it
audienc
in
an
entir
differ
wai
.

but
doe
the
film
work
as
entertain
?

it
darn
funni
in
spot
,
particularli
in
the
men
's
room
scene
,
which
demonstr
the
length
to
which
gui
will
go
to
hold
a
convers
while
engag
in
the
most
basic
of
bodili
function
.

it
work
less
well
as
drama
,
sinc
by
necess
the
charact
in
an
allegori
tend
to
be
flat
cipher
.

staci
edward
give
a
measur
digniti
to
christin
,
and
succe
in
make
us
care
for
her
,
but
by
the
end
of
the
film
we
still
know
noth
about
her
.

likewis
,
chad
and
howard
ar
simpli
the
sum
of
their
action
.

by
the
end
of
the
film
you
'll
feel
as
if
you
've
met
a
genuin
monster
in
chad
;
perhap
we
can
also
classifi
men
as
a
horror
film
.

certainli
those
expect
a
convent
hollywood
resolut
to
the
stori
will
walk
awai
disappoint
.

but
the
pictur
is
often
mesmer
,
and
the
script
is
a
work
of
fine
craftsmanship
,
which
make
it
well
worth
your
time
.

like
all
good
film
,
it
offer
a
myriad
of
parallel
to
the
outsid
world
.

while
watch
chad
in
hi
moment
of
triumph
,
i
could
n't
help
but
think
that
bill
gate
must
have
felt
the
same
sort
of
cold
,
merciless
satisfact
when
he
final
stuck
it
to
steve
job
.

there
mai
be
a
littl
bit
of
chad
in
all
of
us
,
but
some
of
us
have
taken
chad-ness
to
the
level
of
art
.
