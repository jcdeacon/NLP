rather

keep

with

bandera
and
hopkin
have
a
marvel
chemistri
as
the
two
zorro
's
,
plai
each
other
off
with
eas
.

hopkin
seem
to
come
off
a
littl
better
,
but
bandera
doe
some
excel
work
.

as
the
bad
gui
,
wilson
and
letscher
seem
on
dimension
,
but
thei
go
through
the
bad
gui
shtick
in
an
abov
averag
wai
.

the
audienc
doe
hate
them
,
which
ca
n't
be
bad
.

catherin
zeta-jone
also
pop
up
as
hopkin
daughter
,
and
although
she
provid
littl
more
than
the
usual
femal
lead
,
she
deliv
a
charm
,
but
on
note
,
perform
.

the
chemistri
is
excel
between
bandera
and
jone
.

there
's
a
delight
littl
scene
where
bandera
and
jone
have
a
sword
fight
,
and
everi
swipe
an
item
of
cloth
get
slash
,
until
jone
cloth
fall
off
all
togeth
.

the
director
,
fresh
from
the
enjoy
goldeney
-lrb-
1995
-rrb-
handl
the
film
perfectli
.

the
action
is
well
done
and
fast
pace
,
the
comedi
put
across
well
.

the
cast
help
a
lot
,
but
the
direct
is
still
outstand
.

although
the
film
is
veri
long
,
the
plot
keep
chug
along
,
and
there
's
bare
a
dull
moment
.

howev
,
the
film
is
a
littl
over
indulg
,
and
it
could
have
been
trim
.

it
manag
to
hold
the
attent
,
thankfulli
,
and
the
adventur
and
charm
hold
right
up
to
the
last
reel
.

screenwrit
john
eskow
,
ted
elliot
and
terri
rosio
have
unfortun
written
an
clich
and
on
dimension
script
.

although
thei
've
bought
zorro
up
to
date
with
big
explos
and
wild
action
,
the
plot
itself
is
bare
exist
.

there
's
lot
of
littl
sub
plot
hang
around
,
but
there
's
noth
substanti
to
bring
them
all
togeth
.

the
main
stori
seem
to
be
the
fact
that
rafael
want
to
'
bui
'
california
us
gold
stolen
from
the
gui
he
's
bui
the
land
off
.

thi
set
up
for
a
templ
of
doom
type
plot
where
we
see
peasant
slave
driven
into
get
the
gold
from
littl
mine
.

howev
,
thi
doe
n't
seem
to
appear
until
nearli
over
a
hour
into
the
film
,
so
the
film
is
never
quit
sure
where
it
's
go
.

in
the
end
howev
,
zorro
provid
action
and
comedi
in
spade
.

it
suitabl
for
everyon
,
so
put
the
guilt
behind
,
and
put
some
more
monei
into
spielberg
bank
account
.

you
wo
n't
regret
it
.
