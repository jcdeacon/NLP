it
's
up
in
the
air
whether
or
not
we
should
accept
hi
detail
monologu
about
life
after
the
polar

the
question
prove
to
be
moot
,
at

for
a
time
.

even
if
the
whole
thing
prove
to
be
a
creativ

on

but
is
n't
quit
sure
how
to
handl

when
he
start
explain
the

it
's
all
a

much
to
take
in

chalk
it
up

despit

her

loud
and
flash

disingenu
-rrb-
smile
doe
not
necessarili
equal
``

''

it
take
more
than
a
crack
team
of
hair
and
wardrob
peopl
to
imbu
her
with
person
.

then
there
's
that
damn
voic
,
which
strain
to
be
oh-so-ador
.

look
,
thi
stuff
is
pure
subject
.

some
peopl
feel
thi
wai
about
richard
gere

other
can
not
bear
to

for

modern

is
film
with
an
otherworldli
,
vagu
alien
ey
with
a

oddli
reminisc
of
logan

as

d'onofrio
walk
slightli
out-of-step

wonderfulli

often

it
often
fall

-rrb-

at

twenti

long
,
happi
accid
eventu
get
around
to
a
race-against-time
scenario
that
put
``

to
the
ultim

.

no

shall

-rrb-

there
ar
also
some
slow

repetit
stretch
as
rubi
and
sam
go
over
the
same
argument
again
and
again
over
whether
or
not
he
's
crazi

the
premis
is
strong
enough
to
sustain

it
