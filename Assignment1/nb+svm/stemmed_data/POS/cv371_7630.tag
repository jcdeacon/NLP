the

as
wa
the
case
with
_
ghost
in

shell
_
,
if
you
just
want
a
no-brainer
actionfest
,
thi
might
not
be
the
movi
for
you
.

_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
is
more
of
a
psycholog
thriller
,
a
technolog
suspens
drama
.

it
is
closer
,
perhap
,
to
a
chrichton
novel
than
to
an
action
movi
-lrb-
crichton
novel
that
have
been
made

-rrb-
.

there
ar
long
,
thought
montag
of
dialogueless
footag
as
two
investig
make
their
wai
through
slum
and
derelict
hous
in
old
quarter
of
tokyo
,
similar
to
sequenc
from
_
ghost
in
the
shell
_
.

thi
movi
is
fraught
with
symbol
--
in
fact
a
larg
part
of
it
is
base
on
christian
symbol
.

patlabor
's
near-futur
set
is
,
asid
from
the
giant
robot
tromp
around
,
veri
similar
to
our
own
present
dai
.

the
film
us
thi
set
to
make
it
central
point
:
is
progress
move
too
fast
for
human
to
keep
up
?

ar
histori
and
cultur
fall
by
the
waysid
like
the
old
build
that
ar
be
torn
down
and
replac
with
new
?

thi
is
a
question
just
as
applic
to
todai
as
it
is
to
patlabor
's
altern-1999
set
.

as
far
as
the
technic
aspect
of
the
film
go
-lrb-
refer
to
the
subtitl
version
,
as
that
's
the
onli
on
i
've
seen
-rrb-
,
the
film
transfer
is
clear
,
almost
phenomen
so
.

the
anim
qualiti
is
incred
,
though
the
charact
design
is
differ
from
what
most
patlabor
fan
will
be
us
to
.

the
oav
and
tv
seri
were
more
cheer
,
better-suit
to
humor
;
the
movi
,
howev
,
make
everyon
look
a
great
deal
less
cute
,
and
emphas
that
thi
is
go
to
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
a
deadli
seriou
storylin
.

as
far
as
cinematographi
goe
,
there
ar
mani
interest
moment
in
_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
.

i
do
n't
think
i
can
recal
ever
see
a
fish-ey
perspect
us
in
ani
other
anim
film
-lrb-
save
for
_
ghost
in
the
shell
_
,
anoth
oshii
film
-rrb-
,
or
inde
,
in
mani
other
movi
at
all
.

the
cinematographi
is
well-suit
to
the
storylin
,
emphas
what
it
need
to
,
though
a
coupl
of
scene
-lrb-
where
charact
'
featur
ar
exagger
in
anger
-rrb-
mai
seem
slightli
strang
to
western
audienc
.

the
audio
track
of
_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
is
in
gloriou
hi-fi
stereo
,
and
should
be
us
to
demonstr
home
theater
system
--
it
_
is
_
that
good
.

even
without
headphon
,
sound
from
either
side
of
the
screen
can
be
clearli
heard
to
_
come
_
from
that
side
.

giant
robot
footstep
ar
deep
and
boom
.

the
sometim-underst
,
sometim-blare
score
is
crisp
and
clear
,
and
alwai
right
on
the
mark
,
enhanc
the
mood
creat
by
the
anim
sceneri
.

as
far
as
the
subtitl
go
,
i
have
to
sai
that
thei
're
among
the
most
easili-readabl
subtitl
i
've
ever
seen
for
_
anyth
_
.

larg
enough
that
thei
do
n't
strain
the
ey
,
but
small
enough
not
to
conceal
too
much
of
the
screen
.

although
it
doe
have
sever
action
sequenc
in
it
,
most
notabl
the
climact
conclus
,
_
patlabor
_
is
foremost
not
an
action
movi
.

although
it
is
a
superbl-realiz
film
,
it
reli
in
larg
part
upon
prior
familiar
with
some
of
the
charact
to
carri
the
stori
,
and
that
could
detract
from
some
peopl
's
enjoy
.
