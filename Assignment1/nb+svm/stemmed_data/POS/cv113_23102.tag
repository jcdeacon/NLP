even
as

the
nazi
step
up
their
extermin

by

the

would
be

but
by
cut
them
in

,
their
impact
is
multipli
by
five
.

the
last
dai
is
a
talk-head
style
documentari
--
it
's
mostli
pictur
of
peopl
tell
their
stori
,
intercut
with
period
photograph
and
newsreel
footag
.

in
thi
kind
of
movi
it
's
almost
imposs
to
get
archiv
pictur
from
the
same
time
and
place
be
discuss
on-screen
,
but
director
jame
moll
made
a
better
effort
than
most
at
find
specif

or
at

relev

imag
to
go

the

-lrb-
on
of
the
mani
nice
featur
of
thi
dvd
-rrb-
indic
that
there
is
some
never-befor-seen
histor
footag
in
the
last

it
's
not
clear
which
scene
it
is
.

it
could
be
on
of

that
i
had
n't

both

on
is
rare
color
footag
,
shot
by
an
american

of

there
is
someth
jar
,
someth
unsettl
about
see
the
pictur
in
color
,
when
so
much
of
the
footag
from

is
in

there
ha
been
a
glut
of
holocaust
movi
and
i
wa
skeptic
that
a
new
documentari
would
have
anyth
new
to
sai
.

but
by
focus
on
hungarian
jew
dure
the
last
dai
of
the
war
,
moll
told
a
specif
part
of
the
stori
in
a

in

and
i
'm
glad
