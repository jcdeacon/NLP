existenz
ha

call
``
a
gooei
matrix
''
,
and
while
thi
is
a
correct
descript
in
some
wai
,
in
other
it
is
complet
off
.

the
onli
thing
the
two
film
have
in
common
is
the
idea
of
a
virtual
realiti
that
is
indistinguish
from
normal
,
``
real
''
realiti
.

a
major
differ
is
that
``
the
matrix
''
ha
a
base
realiti
that
is
obvious
the
true
realiti
,
while
existenz
doe
the
imposs
and
make
us
accept
the
most
bizarr
realiti
ever
as
true
.

and
oh
what
a
realiti
it
is
.

david

shown
us
befor
that
he
know
how
to
creat
strang

but
thi
on
is
on
of
the
strangest
.

mayb
it
's
becaus
of
how
the
mundan
is
mix
with
the
bizarr
.

-lrb-
refer
to
simpli
as

-rrb-
.

high
technolog
ha
been
replac
with
organ
creatur
,
and
it
provid
a
truli
surreal
set
for
the
charact
.

sort
of
a

-lrb-
ok
,
exactli
like
a
hole
in
your
spine
-rrb-
,
a
bioport
allow
you
to
plug
the
vagu
entrail-look
wire
from
the
pod
into
you
,
allow
you
to
plai
the
game
.

-lrb-
thei

so
off
thei
go

after
a
crazi
seri
of
event
at
the
local
countri
ga
station
,
thei
ar
abl
to
plug
in
and
plai
existenz
.

the
plot
itself
is
a
surreal
meld
of
conspiraci
,
realiti
distort
,
chines
restaur
,
and
multi
appendag
amphibian
thing
-lrb-
``
it
's
a
sign
of
the
time
''
-rrb-
.

but
the
plot
,
while
cohes
in
it
's
own
creepi
wai
is
secondari
to
just
try
to
figur
out
what
the
hell
is
go
on
in
thi
univers
.

cronenberg
just
slap
thi
weird
organ-tech
world
into
the
viewer
lap
,
and
it
's
up
to
you
to
figur
out
how
all
these
thing
work
.

and
that
's
the
true
joi
of
thi
film
,
enter
the
vagu
nightmarish
world
in
which
existenz
take
place
.

you
learn
a
littl
bit
piec
by
piec
-lrb-
oh
,
thei
make
pod
out
of
those
-rrb-
,
and
it
's
just
enough
to
get
you
to
accept
the
world
that
is
present
to
you
.

there
ar
all
kind
of
twist
and
turn
as
the
charact
wander
around
,
includ
a
fantast
scene
in
a
chines
restaur
that
will
leav
you
try
to
assembl
someth
out
of
your
moo
goo
gai
pan
for
month
afterward
.

also
the
bioport
ar
occasion
us
for
thing
other
than
port
into
existenz
,
the
specif
of
which
i
will
leav
for
you
to
discov
.

there
's
lot
of
littl
thing
that
set
off
the
weird-o-meter
,
like
the
littl
tini
pod
that
you
can
bui
in
the
video
game
store
,
the
two
head
amphibian
creatur
,
and
why
that
gui
at
the
ga
station
's
name
appear
to
be
``
ga
''
.

it
all
add
up
to
a
suprem
far
out
trip
,
and
given
the
choic
i
think
i
would
rather
live
in
the
matrix
's
virtual
world
...
oh
wait
,
i
alreadi
