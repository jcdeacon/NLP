it
's
not
often
that
i
laugh
so
hard
at
a
movi
that
my
head
hurt
.

but
that
's
just
what
happen
to
me
at
uhf
,
weird
al
yankov
's
big
screen
debut
.

uhf
is
a
televis
parodi
a
la
airplan
,
and
like
airplan
,
the
movi
is
extraordinarili
stupid
.

but
it
's
dumb
in
the
best
wai
a
movi
can
be
dumb
:
it
's
so
silli
and
outrag
it
's
hilari
.

the
movi
star
weird
al
as
georg
newman
,
a
world
class
nerd
with
a
hyperact
imagin
,
the
type
who
fantas
he
's
indiana
jone
and
who
us
hostess
twinki
as
hot
dog
bun
.

georg
is
basic
a
loser
;
hi
daydream
and
smart-alec
attitud
perpetu
prevent
him
from
hold
onto
a
job
for
more
than
two
week
.

but
georg
final
get
a
chanc
to
funnel
hi
creativ
into
someth
product
when
hi
uncl
win
channel

in
a
poker
game
and
make
him

gener
manag
of
the
struggl

channelwith
innov
program
:
show
like
``
wheel
of
fish
''
and
movi
like
``
conan
,
the
librarian
.
''

as
the
station
's
rate
rise
,
it
come
into
competit
with
channel
8
,
the
lead
vhf
network-affili
.

as
r.j.
fletcher
--
channel

's
ill-natur
,
hard-nose
owner
--
veteran
stage
and
film
actor
kevin
mccarthi
is
flamboyantli
sleazi
;
he
realli
ham
it
up
with
hi
snort
,
grimac
,
and
scowl
.

uhf
satir
anyth
and
everyth
to
do
with
televis
,
includ
game
show
,
tabloid
talk
show
,
children
's
show
,
dizzi
new
women
,
and
movi
--
everyth
from
rambo
to
close
encount
.

the
funniest
scene
,
the
on
that
made
my
head
spin
,
is
a
commerci
for
spatula
which
ha
to
be
seen
to
be
believ
.

like
most
movi
in
it
genr
,
uhf
is
hit
or
miss
.

for
everi
gag
that
work
,
at
least
on
fizzl
.

for
instanc
,
weird
al
's
mock
video
of
``
monei
for
noth
''
by
dire
strait
is
onli
mildli
amus
and
bring
the
film
to
a
grind
halt
-lrb-
although
it
doe
have
some
nifti
comput
anim
-rrb-
.

but
the
funniest
bit
in
uhf
ar
so
hyster
that
we
can
forgiv
the
on
that
fail
;
we
know
anoth
gut
wrencher
is
on
the
wai
.

in
fact
,
uhf
hit
the
mark
often
enough
to
make
it
the
most
effect
airplan-type
movi
sinc
...
well
,
sinc
airplan
.

much
of
the
credit
goe
to
weird
al
's
exception
invent
script
and
to
the
movi
's
winsom
cast
.

weird
al
seem
a
littl
stiff
at
the
begin
,
but
becaus
he
's
not
afraid
to
look
silli
,
he
ultim
ha
a
lot
of
fun
with
hi
charact
.

the
real
standout
is
michael
richard
as
stanlei
,
the
dim-wit
janitor
who
becom
the
host
of
hi
own
children
's
show
:
``
stanlei
spadowski
's
playhous
.
''

stanlei
's
off-beat
,
mix-up
person
is
a
big
hit
with
the
audienc
and
make
him
an
over-night
star
.

he
is
an
endear
mixtur
of
good-natur
innoc
,
high-energi
enthusiasm
,
and
puppi-dog
cute
.

and
abov
all
,
he
's
a
good
janitor
who
ador
hi
work
.

anoth
highlight
is
a
vintag
cameo
by
the
incompar
emo
philip
.

the
cast
also
featur
gedd
watanab
-lrb-
the
chines
foreign-exchang
student
in
sixteen
candl
-rrb-
as
the
karat
master
who
host
the
hit
seri
,
``
wheel
of
fish
.
''

also
aboard
for
the
ride
is
fran
drescher
,
who
plai
pamela
finklestein
,
channel
62
's
rove
report
.

unfortun
,
as
weird
al
's
girlfriend
,
victoria
jackson
is
wast
in
a
role
that
call
for
noth
but
whimper
,
whine
,
and
sulk
.

her
charact
is
extran
and
should
have
been
either
further
integr
into
the
stori
or
cut
from
the
script
altogeth
.

while
uhf
is
not
an
absolut
must-see
,
it
's
definit
the
ticket
if
you
're
look
for
a
wild
and
zani
,
whack-out
comedi
.

the
movi
is
good
enough
to
see
in
the
theater
,
but
it
mai
work
even
better
on
televis
,
the
veri
medium
at
which
it
poke
fun
.
