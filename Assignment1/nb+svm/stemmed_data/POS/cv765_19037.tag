becaus
of

thi
,
you
might
ask
yourself
,
wa
the

realli
such
a

the
peopl
who
had

did
n't

so
.

in

,
mani
peopl
had

for

,
but
of
cours
,
thei
deni
it
.

for
a
while
,
it
seem
like
the
black

would
never
be
releas
to

until
septemb
1997
,
disnei
releas
the
black
cauldron
to

.

few
peopl
import
the

for

-rrb-
,
thei
got
quit
a

but
peopl
who
had

notic
that
in

where
the

'

,
and
becaus
of
that
,
disnei
final
decid
to
releas
the

to

befor
that
time
,
rumor
onlin
had
been
made
that
the

would
be
trim
,
like
the
uk
video
,
so
that
it
would
get
a

and
that
thei
would

those

were
put
to

some

some
felt
that
it

inde
cut

but
some
felt
that
it
wa
n't
.

but
these
where
onli
minor
critic
which
seem
laughabl
,
sinc
a
film
that
wa
absent
for
thirteen
year
wa
final
avail
.

as
for
myself
,
when
i
saw
the
movi
for
the
first
time
-lrb-
on
convert
ntsc
video
-rrb-
,
i
did
n't
expect
much
at
all
.

in
fact
,
i
had
heard
so
mani
mediocr
thing
about
it
,
that
i
did
n't
think
the
film
would
ever
be
such
a
good
film
.

much
to
my
surpris
,
when
i
saw
the
first
few
minut
of
the
film
,
i
wa
ask
myself
,
``
thi
is
the
same
film
everyon
saw
?
''

the
on
that
flop
at
the
box
offic
?

the
on
that
critic
and
filmgoer
alik
call
``
a
bad
movi
''
?

thi
doe
n't
seem
like
all
of
the
abov
.

instead
,
it
's
a
classic
in
it
own
right
.

the
film
ha
a
wonder
cast
of
charact
.

there
's
taran
-lrb-
grant
bardslei
-rrb-
,
an
assist
pig
keeper
who
would
rather
be
a
warrior
than
a
pig-keeper
,
the
stori
's
hero
.

the
critic
have
said
that
taran
is
not
likeabl
at
all
,
but
the
opposit
is
true
.

he
is
brave
,
loyal
,
and
eventu
learn
a
lesson
about
friendship
later
on
.

there
's
a
likeabl
charact
here
!

not
that
he
's
the
onli
likeabl
charact
in
the
film
.

there
's
gurgi
-lrb-
john
biner
-rrb-
,
a
lovabl
littl
,
uh
,
thing
who
remain
loyal
to
taran
,
even
though
thei
do
n't
quit
hit
it
off
at
first
.

but
anoth
likeabl
charact
is
the
bad
gui
comic
henchman
,
a
dwarf
name
creeper
-lrb-
phil
fondacairo
-rrb-
,
who
is
loyal
to
the
film
's
imagin
and
sinist
villain
,
the
horn
king
-lrb-
voic
gruesom
by
john
hurt
-rrb-
,
yet
he
also
fear
hi
neck
.

the
other
charact
,
includ
the
sidekick
,
a
spunki
,
but
sweet
princess
name
eilonwi
and
the
comic
bard
fflewdurr
flamm
,
and
three
comic
wick
witch
who
hide
a
dark
secret
,
although
pleasant
and
likeabl
,
ar
n't
quit
as
well
round
as
thei
should
be
.

the
stori
itself
is
an
adventur
on
,
a
quest
involv
the
mystic
pig
,
hen
wen
,
the
black
cauldron
itself
,
and
an
armi
of
deathless
on
with
everyth
:
a
hook
open
to
a
spectacular
final
.

elmer
bernstein
's
music
also
tell
the
stori
perfectli
,
in
a
dark
,
yet
calm
manner
.

the
anim
itself
is
surprisingli
good
consid
that
thi
film
wa
creat
in
the
darkest
time
of
the
studio
.

even
though
there
ar
some
occasion
effect
that
ar
not
quit
good
,
like
the
ground
open
when
the
black
cauldron
rise
out
of
the
earth
,
the
anim
overal
is
top
notch
.

overal
?

thi
film
is
an
entertain
endeavor
.

fan
unfamiliar
to
the
lloyd
alexand
chronicl
of
prydain
will
get
a
kick
out
of
thi
on
,
except
young
kid
.

there
ar
some
extrem
scari
scene
which
ar
more
darker
than
disnei
's
other
film
-lrb-
although
some
consid
the
stamped
sequenc
from
the
lion
king
and
frollo
observ
esmeralda
in
the
fire
of
hell
in
the
hunchback
of
notr
dame
ar
just
as
scari
-rrb-
,
which
is
the
main
reason
why
thi
film
is
rate
pg
.

fan
familiar
to
the
lloyd
alexand
seri
will
recogn
the
differ
between
the
novel
and
the
movi
.

even
though
it
doe
n't
have
all
of
the
ingredi
of
a
true
disnei
film
,
thi
film
is
a
classic
in
it
own

,
and
deserv
a
far
better
chanc
than
what
it
ha
been
given
.

that
better
chanc
ha
final
come

whatev
reason
about
why
the
black

wa
such
a
big
failur
seem
to
have
disappear
,
and
the
film
ha
final
achiev
