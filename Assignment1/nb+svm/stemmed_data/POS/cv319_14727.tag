it
been
rumor
that

and
to
think
it
about
male
exot
dancer
,
and
not
sink
ship
.

six
steel
worker
who
have
been
recent
been
laid
off
and
ar
all
look
for
job
.

inspir
by
the
success
of
a
chippendal
's
product
,
gaz
-lrb-
robert
carlyl
-rrb-
decid
thei
should

some
monei
quickli
.

as
the
six
team
up
to
put
on
the
show
of
their
live
,
thei
run
into
a
few
problem
.

for

receiv
four

which
left

?

while
the
full

is
a

lightheart
comedi
,
it
doe
n't
carri
the
social
impact
of
the
brilliant
trainspot
.

still
,
the
full

is
a
great
film
,
a
must
