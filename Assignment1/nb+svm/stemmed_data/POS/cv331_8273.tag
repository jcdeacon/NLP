by

the
audienc
is
left
with
what
good
scienc

is
suppos
to
do
:
evok
a
sens
of
wonder
about
the
univers
and
evok
question
in
your

about
what
's
out
there

thi
is
clearli
a

by

of
the
great

foster
's
radianc
ha
never
been
more
strong
than
in
the
scene
where
she
final
meet
the
vegan
on
their
term
.

earli
scene
take
a
long
,
long
time
to
build
up
to
thi
.

the
movi

pace
is
veri

the

polit
of

charact
attempt
to
obtain

for
research
at
these
place
ar
trite
and
predict
howev
.

on
of
the
most
entertain
,
but
veri
short
scene
,
is
when
foster
is
confront
by
rob
low
,
dure
a
cabinet-level
presidenti
meet
to
discuss
the
alien
invit
.

there
were
real
spark
in
thi
scene
between
foster
and
low
and
it
would
behoov
them
to
consid
other
vehicl
in
which
thi
dynam
could
be
explor
.

it
is
the
onli
scene
in
the
movi
in
which
there
were
tremend
dynam
between
two
charact
.

.

low
can
stand
up
to
foster
and
it
show
in
that
scene
at
the
cabinet
tabl
.

the
core
scene
of
the
movi
is
set
on
a
surrealist
beach
on
a
far-awai
world
in
the
starsystem
of
vega
.

it
feel
a
lot
like
scienc
fiction
writer
john
varlei
's
scene
in
hi
book
steel
beach
,
where
the
femal
protagonist
encount
an
immens
superior
intellig
,
in
on
case
a
comput
manufactur
by
mankind
itself
,
and
in
foster
's
case
,
an
illus
drawn
from
her
memori
.

in
anoth
sens
,
thi
immens
move
scene
evok
gene
roddenberri
's
star
trek
pilot
the
cage
,
later
the
menageri
,
when
jeffrei
hunter
and
susan
oliv
have
their
memori
manipul
to
creat
new
world
in
which
thei
live
and
encount
alien
.

the
concept
is
not
new
,
by
ani
sens
,
in
the
world
of
scienc
fiction
.

but
the
beach
scene
,
which
is
the
centerpiec
of
the
film
,
as
is
the
whole
film
,
is
driven
by
foster
.

freed
from
her
need
to
direct
by
director
zemecki
,
foster
is
abl
to
let
it
all
hang
out
in
the
character
and
the
lead
she
provid
to
her
support
cast
.

as
the
movi
gain
speed
,
foster
's
act
intensifi
and
the
audienc
realli
doe
experi
it
with
her
.

it
is
certainli
oscar-calib
act
,
unquestion
.

the
support
cast
doe
well
and
zemecki
throw
in
some
humor
with
some
presid
clinton
cameo
,
cleverli
manipul
,
georg
stephanopolu-style
,
to
seem
veri
forrest
gump
.

in
fact
,
zemecki
et
.

al.
got
in
troubl
for
the
usag
of
some
of
the
footag
seen
in
the
movi
,
vi
a
vi
clinton
.

but
the
audienc
i
attend
thi
movi
with
just
had
some
good
chuckl
at
clinton
's
walk-on
.

the
much-discuss
tension
between
scienc
and
religion
in
thi
movi
is
not
particularli
insight
to
those
who
have
alreadi
gone
through
thi
cours
though
it
is
help
to
those
in
the
audienc
who
have
not
.

also
,
the
near-final
scene
,
in
a
senat
judiciari
hear
room
is
disappoint
.

contact
is
a
fit
memori
to
the
memori
of
carl
sagan
,
scienc
popular
,
and
sometim
pedant
gadfli
of
the
hall
of
academ
.

perhap
now
,
sagan
can
be
said
to
be
with
hi
dragon
of
eden
.
