save
privat
ryan
is
a

compos
film
.

the
direct
is
out
of
thi
world
,
sure
the
type
of
command
that
can
win
spielberg
anoth
direct
oscar
.

the
cinematographi
,
by
janusz
kaminski
,
is
also
astound
.

but
be
forewarn
,
thi
is
the
most
violent
and
graphic
film
i
have
ever
seen
.

the
articl
you
read
and
the
warn
you
see
ar
justifi
;
save
privat
ryan
is
visual
as
disturb
as
a
film
can
get
.

the
question
is
,
``
doe
the
stori
and
it
realism
justifi
the
excess
us
?
''

the
answer
from
my
point
of
view
is
``
no
''
.

braveheart
wa
a
truli
gritti
,
and
,
on
would
imagin

ryan

ten
time
wors
.

expect
disembowel
,
suck
in
skull
,
head
blown
to
bit
,
arm
and
leg
fly
across
the
battlefield
.

mani
in
the
theater
could
not
bear
to
watch
.

and
it
is
a
shame
,
too
,
becaus
thi
is
otherwis
by
far
on
of
the
standout
thi
year
.

but
such
graphic
displai
mai

even
the
most
loyal

take
us
from
the
attack
at
omaha
beach
on

,
1944
,
through
into
the
film
's
primari
mission
.

captain

an
8
man
crew
and
set
off
to

whose

doe
n't

a
fourth

of

about
her

that
no

miller

not

harbor
a

for

,
though
there
is
a
lot
of
set
up
between

,
the
stori
continu
full

to

the
pace
and
dramat
of
the
extrem

is
realli
in
a
leagu
of

own
.

spielberg

take

do

in

the

not

thei

thi
