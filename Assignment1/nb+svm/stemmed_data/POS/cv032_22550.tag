not

the
film
,
which
won
best
pictur
in
1967
focus
on
vergil
tibb
,
plai
superbl
by
sidnei
poitier
as
a
fearless
african
american
polic
offic
from
philadelphia
who
refus
to
give
up
on
an
investig
in
a
white
town
where
is
he
not
want
.

tibb
is
a
man
who
rare
lose
hi
temper
and
that
is
worth
mention
becaus
he
is
constantli
face
abus
from
those
around
him
.

as
a
hero
who
is
not
afraid
to
face
off
against
five
men
with
chain
,
tibb
is
the
perfect
protagonist
.

poitier
also
give
an
excel
,
noteworthi
voic
to
hi
charact
.

never
nervou
and
alwai
command
,
hi
speech
pattern
ar
veri
manipul
as
thei
rang
from
stentorian
to
sooth
.

howev
,
unlik
``
the
hurrican
''
where
denzel
washington
domin
over
the
rest
of
the
cast
,
poitier
share
the
spotlight
with
rod
steiger
,
who
won
best
actor
for
hi
excel
perform
.

as
a
sheriff
who
help
tibb
and
warn
him
of
the
danger
around
him
,
steiger
show
a
great
amount
of
skill
in
hi
role
.

he
start
off
as
racist
and
blind
as
the
other
townspeopl
.

he
would
refer
to
tibb
as
``
boi
''
and
would
alwai
suspici
keep
an
ey
on
him
.

as
the
film
progress
though
,
there
is
a
veri
gradual
chang
in
the
sheriff
.

he
begin
to
see
the
hardship
tibb
face
and
he
see
the
foolish
of
hi
own
neighbor
.

what
i
realli
enjoi
about
steiger
's
charact
wa
that
he
did
not
complet
abandon
hi
friend
or
connect
with
tibb
at
the
end
of
the
film
.

he
still
could
not
refer
to
tibb
as
mister
tibb
or
offic
tibb
but
rather
settl
for
virgil
.

instead
,
it
wa
appar
that
he
wa
eventu
go
to
see
the
world
differ
in
the
futur
.

most
movi
would
have
a
charact
revers
all
of
hi
belief
and
influenc
in
a
matter
of
minut
.

thi
action
would
not
have
been
realist
at
all
sinc
it
is
nearli
imposs
for
someon
to
believ
someth
on
dai
and
believ
someth
els
the
next
dai
.

jewison
's
determin
to
make
thi
film
as
realist
as
possibl
is
veri
obviou
here
and
also
veri
appropri
.

``

''
show
the
differ
between
the
north
and
the
south
or
a
major
citi
and
a
small
town
in

it
displai

.

howev
,
the

,
although
it
is
not
the
main
focu
of
the

lack
interest

it
seem
rush
especi
toward
the
end
as
if
jewison
had
given
hi
messag
about
racism
and
did
not
feel
like
give
a
credibl
explan

the
murder

there
