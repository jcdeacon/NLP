as
fairi
tale
go
,
cinderella
ha
to
be
on
of
the
most
famou
.

almost
everyon
know
it
,
well
at
least
in
north
america
.

so
it
is
natur
that
someon
will
try
to
make
a
movi
out
of
it
.

it
ha
been
done
befor
with
vari
result
.

thi
version
of
the
stori
is
both
similar
to
the
origin
and
differ
at
the
same
time
.

the
basic
stori
remain
unchang
but
,
on
thing
that
seem
to
vanish
with
thi
version
,
and
that
is
all
the
fantast
element
of
the
stori
.

there
is
no
fairi
god
mother
or
anyth
even
remot
of
that
natur
.

after
the
fantast
element
ar
strip
awai
what
is
left
is
a
realist
believ
rendit
of
the
cinderella
stori
and
an
interest
love
stori
at
the
least
.
.

unlik
in
the
fairi
tale
,
the
princ
plai
a
much
larger
part
than
just
that
of
the
mask
ball
at
the
end
.

the
princ
'
,
who
happen
to
be
the
crown
princ
to
the
throne
of
franc
,
meet
'
cinderella
'
,
known
as
daniel
,
on
a
few
occas
,
most
coincident
and
he
becom
smitten
with
her
.

although
thi
seem
to
be
a
far
cry
from
the
tradit
stori
it
allow
for
the
main
plot
to
proce
with
enough
room
for
some
imagin
stori
tell
.
.

the
stori
take
place
in
a
renaiss
set
;
in
franc
,
with
leonardo
da
vinci
provid
some
comic
relief
on
more
than
on
occas
.

thi
addit
of
leonardo
da
vinci
,
wa
quit
success
in
that
it
ad
some
color
to
the
movi
,
sinc
some
of
the
role
ar
a
bit
stereotyp
.

for
exampl
the
role
that
wa
script
for
the
princ
leav
a
few
thing
to
be
desir
.

for
instanc
the
charact
seem
to
be
a
bit
too
unstabl
and
fickl
,
a
crown
princ
should
not
be
anyth
remot
like
that
.

especi
sinc
he
is
portrai
to
be
in
hi
mid
twenti
at
the
least
and
almost
readi
to
take
the
throne
.

the
charact
of
daniel
-lrb-
cinderella
-rrb-
plai
by
drew
barrymor
,
and
that
of
the
evil
step
mother
,
plai
by
anjelica
huston
,
ar
well
develop
and
well
plai
by
the
two
women
.

although
the
part
of
daniel
is
a
bit
stretch
it
is
not
too
unlik
and
not
total
unbeliev
.

the
nuanc
of
the
charact
ar
brought
out
well
by
drew
barrymor
and
from
watch
the
movi
it
seem
like
she
had
fun
make
the
movi
.

as
a
contrast
the
part
of
the
evil
step
mother
is
clearli
seen
from
the
veri
begin
and
is
almost
cliqu
.

but
,
anjelica
huston
seem
to
add
a
certain
flair
to
the
role
that
make
it
suit
the
movi
nearli
perfectli
.

the
actual
stori
is
fairli
predict
sinc
it
is
after
all
the
basic
stori
of
cinderella
,
but
there
ar
more
than
enough
twist
in
how
the
stori
is
told
to
make
it
interest
and
enjoy
.

the
act
is
of
high
calib
and
seem
deserv
of
prais
.

all
in
all
thi
movi
take
you
back
into
histori
,
into
a
seemingli
magic
fairi
land
.

but
,
do
n't
get
me
wrong
there
is
noth
but
realiti
,
it
is
just
refresh
to
watch
a
movi
that
is
not
base
in
a
familiar
set
with
everydai
familiar
thing
happen
.

so
although
the
stori
is
basic
familiar
the
world
it
is
set
in
is
not
,
and
that
add
a
dimens
to
the
film
which
in
thi
humbl
review
opinion
make
it
worth
see
.
