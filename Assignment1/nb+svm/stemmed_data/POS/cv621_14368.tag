''

mr.
kaplan
actual
spend
much
of
hi
time
these
dai
plai
profession
high-stake
poker
.

that
's
right
.

i
'm
not
sure
if
it
's
hi
main
sourc
of
incom
,
but
from
what
i
've
heard
,
the
gui
occasion
come
awai
with
$
20,000
at
a
time
.

and
there
you
were
,
think
i
wa
go
to
tell
you
he
wa
do
off-broadwai
theater
.

you
silli
goos
.

well
,
gabe
kaplan
is
n't
in
the
movi
rounder
,
nor
is
the
film
about
the
actor
come
gambler
's
life
.

but
rounder
is
about
poker
,
and
gabe
plai
poker
,
and
i
thought
that
wa
kind
of
a
neat
connect
.

sorri
about
the
segu
,
or
lack
thereof
.

matt
damon
plai
mike
mcdermott
,
a
law
student
who
also
ha
a
singular
talent
for
the
game
of
poker
.

he
's
been
plai
for
a
while
,
and
more
than
be
profici
,
he
ha
caught
the
bug
.

he
goe
to
all
the
underground
game
in
new
york
citi
,
know
the
regular
,
and
know
how
to
win
.

in
the
begin
of
the
film
,
he
's
built
up
a
nice
thirti
grand
nest
egg
,
which
he
take
to
the
speakeasi-type
game
parlor
where
the
big
boi
plai
.

mike
is
there
to
make
hi
bid
into
the
upper
echelon
by
stake
it
all
against
teddi
kgb
-lrb-
john
malkovich
-rrb-
,
an
oreo-munch
cardshark
with
ti
to
the
russian
mafia
.

mike
ha
the
potenti
to
take
a
larg
pot
and
go
to
vega
and
bui
into
the
world
seri
of
poker
,
but
instead
he
lose
it
all
in
a
singl
hand
.

month
later
,
he
's
pai
hi
wai
through
law
school
by
drive
a
deliveri
truck
.

when
mike
's
best
friend
and
poker
buddi

finish
hi

thei
left
off
,
work
as
a
team
to
part
other
with
their

although
mike
ha
stop
plai
card
as
a
promis
to
hi
girlfriend
and
fellow

,
jo
-lrb-
gretchen

-rrb-
,
worm
conniv
mike
into
plai
onc
more
,
and
mike
,
bitten
again
by
the
bug
,
slide
down
that
slipperi
slope
,
risk
hi
relationship
,
educ
,
and
reput
as
plai
poker
again
becom
the
focu
of
hi
life
.

to
make
a
film
about
gambl
,
a
filmmak
will
usual
have
to
plai
up
the
glamor
side
to
get
the
audienc
behind
the
charact
.

thi
is
becaus
few
moviego
will
care
a
whole
lot
about
some
gui
in
a
leisur
suit
or
terri
cloth
shirt
sit
at
a
fold
card
tabl
with
a
stogi
in
hi
mouth
.

rounder
,
howev
,
seem
to
go
more
for
the
latter
than
the
former
.

the
card
club
mike
and
worm
frequent
ar
n't
veri
glamor
at
all
.

there
's
a
basement
,
a
lodg
with
elk
head
on
the
wall
,
a
goulash
joint-these
ar
the
kind
of
local
in
which
director
john
dahl
set
hi
shot
.

except
for
on
brief
instanc
when
the
two
player
visit
atlant
citi
,
the
film
is
bereft
of
the
flash
light
of
the
casino
or
the
pleasant
color
of
the
green
felt
tabl
.

the
reason
rounder
still
captur
our
attent
is
becaus
it
is
less
about
the
game
of
poker
than
it
is
about
the
person
which
enjoi
and
ar
slave
to
it
.

we
're
given
a
nice
set
of
interest
charact
with
clear
motiv
,
and
good
actor
to
plai
them
.

matt
damon
is
veri
natur
as
mike
,
who
struggl
between
hi
desir
to
plai
the
straight
and
narrow
by
finish
law
school
,
and
answer
what
mai
be
hi
true
call
,
plai
profession
poker
.

ed
norton
's
worm
is
truli
a
worm
,
alwai
look
for
the
angl
and
plai
everyon
for
what
thei
're
worth
.

john
turturro
,
who
amaz
me
with
hi
act
rang
,
tone
it
down
in
thi
film
by
plai
joei
knish
,
a
virtual
poker
prodigi
in
hi
time
who
now
plai
the
underground
game
to
make
rent
and
child
support
payment
.

he
's
both
a
friend
and
mentor
to
mike
,
and
turturro
's
low-kei
perform
is
total
convinc
,
just
as
john
malkovich
's
heavili-accent
teddi
kgb
is
impos
as
an
adversari
dragon
mike
must
slai
to
prove
himself
.

martin
landau
is
also
thrown
into
the
mix
as
on
of
mike
's
law
professor
,
ab
petrovski
.

while
landau
slip
well
into
the
role
,
hi
charact
,
spit
out
person
anecdot
about
stai
true
to
on
's
self
,
facilit
the
channel
of
the
storylin
toward
a
predict
end
.

perhap
the
weak
link
in
the
otherwis
formid
line-up
of
act
talent
,
howev
,
is
gretchen
mol
who
just
did
n't
seem
to
have
much
presenc
on
screen
.

she
's
a
genuin
peach
to
look
at
,
kind
of
a
cross
between
actress
rene
zellweg
and
singer
jewel
-lrb-
and
i
would
n't
be
surpris
if
the
three
of
them
form
some
kind
of
blond-hair
triumvir
and
attempt
to
take
over
the
world
-rrb-
,
but
her
deliv
line
seem
veri
flat
,
and
i
found
myself
look
for
matt
damon
's
reaction
instead
.

a
good
thing
about
rounder
is
that
it
doe
n't
get
bog
down
in
the
charact
develop
and
statement
make
so
much
that
it
ca
n't
find
time
for
humor
.

the
film
is
pepper
nice
with
scene
that
both
make
you
laugh
and
keep
the
pace
go
,
such
as
a
sequenc
where
mike
and
worm
move
rapidli
around
new
york
from
on
game
to
the
next
,
in
wide
differ
local
.

on
game
in
a
cigar
club
had
me
in
stitch
.

``
i
love
the
sweet
of
thi
dark
maduro
wrapper
,
''
sai
on
of
the
player
,
clearli
more
interest
in
displai
hi
pretenti
over
the
cigar
in
on
hand
than
in
the
card
in
hi
other
.

i
wa
hope
mike
and
worm
would
realli
take
these
gui
.

with
all
the
poker
be
plai
,
rounder
had
the
potenti
to
be
veri
confus
.

you
might
think
you
know
a
lot
about
poker
,
but
think
again
.

luckili
,
we
're
given
a
narrat
by
damon
dure
the
more
intric
moment
to
explain
what
's
go
on
.

the
narrat
ar
more
inform
than
intrus
,
and
appris
us
of
what
the
stake
ar
and
why
certain
player
want
to
do
the
thing
thei
do
.

it
's
nice
that
as
the
charact
develop
,
so
doe
our
comprehens
of
their
world
.

as
a
film
about
success
and
surviv
in
the
realm
of
underground
poker
,
rounder
deliv
in
spade
.

wait
!

as
a
film
about
the
cultur
of
card
,
rounder
is
an
ac
.

hang
on
!

pack
with
great
act
and
great
charact
,
rounder
is
a
full
hous
.

okai
,
i
guess
that
's
enough
.

oh
,
by
the
wai
,
if
you
ever
want
to
get
into
a
game
with
ol
'
gabe
kaplan
,
be
sure
to
bring
a
note
from
epstein
's
mother
.
