hear
charli
sheen
deliv
the
line
,
``
i
guess
there
is
someth
to

''
is
the
funniest
thing
i
have
ever
heard
in
a
movi
sinc
matthew
broderick
discuss
asexu
reproduct
in
wargam
.

thi
is
just
the
setup
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
give
too
much
awai
,
becaus
a
larg
part
of
the
movi
fun
is
the
surpris
.

charli
sheen
,
who
ha
had
a
rocki
career
as
of
late
,
is
in
top
form
here
.

he
is
funni
,
seriou
,
and
determin
to
accomplish
hi
goal
.

sheen
's
absolut
terrif
perform
is
anoth
big
plu
to
thi
movi
.

the
stori
is
ingeni
devis
by
twohi
,
who
also
wrote
and
direct
the
equal
clever
cabl
movi
grand
tour
:
disast
in
time
.

the
film
major
flaw
is
a
veri
slow
pace
,
and
not
much
happen
in
the
earlygo
.

viewer
mai
be
grow
restless
for
a
while
,
but
trust
me
if
you
stick
around
and
keep
your
head
in
it
,
you
will
have
a
good
time
.
