the
farrelli
brother
'
third
film
,
after
dumb
and
dumber
and
kingpin
,
bring
togeth
the
real-life
coupl
of
cameron
diaz
and
matt
dillon
,
some
nasti
humour
,
a
cute
dog
,
and
a
mix
of
love
,
fate
and
romanc
.

high-school
nerd
ted
get
lucki
when
the
cutest
girl
in
hi
class
ask
him
to
the
prom
.

unfortun
for
ted
,
he
accident
get
a
part
of
hi
male
anatomi
-lrb-
ouch
!
-rrb-

caught
in
hi
zipper
,
and
miss
the
big
night
.

thirteen
year
later
,
ted
still
ca
n't
get
mari
out
of
hi
mind
,
and
hire
a
privat
detect
-lrb-
dillon
-rrb-
to
find
her
.

onc
found
,
it
turn
out
that
mari
ha
more
than
on
suitor
,
and
that
's
when
the
real
fun
begin
.

critiqu
:
likeabl
comedi
with
a
few
extrem
funni
scene
,
some
funni
look
peopl
,
and
a
plot
that
wo
n't
ever
put
you
to
sleep
.

have
said
that
,
i
must
admit
that
i
did
like
the
farrelli
'
two
previou
film
more
than
thi
on
,
but
that
is
sai
a
lot
,
sinc
i
realli
did
love
those
earlier
pic
.

thi
on
is
also
quit
funni
,
but
it
did
n't
realli
blow
me
awai
like
the
other
.

then
again
,
mayb
my
expect
were
too
high
.

then
again
,
mayb
i
should
shut
up
,
and
write
a
littl
more
about
the
film
,
and
less
about
my
suppos
subconsci
reason
for
like/dislik
the
film
.

continu
where
their
other
pictur
left
off
,
the
farrelli
'
creat
a
cutesi
world
of
peopl
with
strang
and
endear
qualiti
,
and
a
simpl
plot
by
which
to
tie
them
all
togeth
.

thi
on
also
includ
plenti
of
toilet
humour
,
but
also
some
borderlin
fun-make
of
the
disabl
and
mental-challeng
.

i
must
admit
that
i
realli
wa
n't
sure
whether
to
laugh
at
some
point
or
not
.

not
a
good
place
to
be
.

have
said
that
,
the
scene
that
did
tear
through
the
audienc
,
and
your
truli
,
were
extrem
hilari
,
and
went
on
for
sever
minut
after
the
punchlin
.

the
laughter
practic
kill
out
the
next
scene
for
on
of
the
best
on
in
the
movi
-lrb-
someth
to
do
with
hair
gel
-rrb-
.

on
the
neg
end
,
i
did
not
like
the
music
interlud
of
jonathan
richman
that
ran
through
the
entir
pictur
.

i
found
them
quit
useless
,
unfunni
and
distract
.

also
,
i
found
that
a
lot
of
the
funnier
scene
had
alreadi
been
shown
in
the
film
's
trailer
.

and
of
cours
,
i
never
quit
bui
the
fact
that
these
beauti
,
intellig
,
singl
women
still
ca
n't
seem
to
find
the
``
right
gui
''
-lrb-
see
kiss
the
girl
-lrb-
7/10
-rrb-
.

i
did
realli
like
all
of
the
actor
in
the
film
,
especi
ben
stiller
,
who
appear
to
be
solidifi
hi
mark
as
a
great
comic
actor
with
thi
pictur
and
on
of
my
favourit
from
1996

i
also
like
matt
dillon
with
hi
big
teeth
,
and
lee

superb
faux-sympathi
