european

will
see
the

as

.

roger
ebert
call
the
american
version
the
``
austin
power
version
,
''
and
mani
other
have
bash
the
alter
.

i
am
of
the
potenti
controversi
opinion
that
the
figur
onli
supplement
the
scene
's
mystic
atmospher
.

the
first
thing
on
notic
about
ey
wide
shut
is
how
it
look
.

thi
is
an
art
,
distinct
gorgeou
product
,
shot
in
dark
,
moodi
hue
and
featur
some
elabor
,
beauti
sceneri
.

from
the
giant
mansion
us
in
the
film
's
centerpiec
to
the
decor
at
the
christma
parti
to
the
harford
's
apart
,
thi
film
is
alwai
a
pleasur
to
look
at
.

to
boot
,
a
great
soundtrack
make
it
more
atmospher
still
.

at
the
core
,
behind
the
graphic
,
controversi
content
and
unapp
mood
,
thi
is
a
good-natur
movi
that
emphas
the
import
of
fidel
.

it
look
at
sex
as
almost
perfunctori
by
portrai
it
as
unnerv
rather
than
erot
.

it
's
someth
superfici
and
yet
someth
necessari
to
achiev
a
deeper
relationship
.

at
the
end
,
it
seem
,
bill
's
ey
ar
wide
open
to
the
special
kind
of
love
he
and
hi
wife
have
for
each
other
,
more
meaning
than
anyth
he
could
ever
hope
to
find
on
the
street
of
new
york
.

kubrick
elicit
wonder
perform
from
both
cruis
and
kidman
.

tom
is
complet
convinc
as
dr.
harford
,
a
man
who
seem
guid
sole
by
destini
,
with
no
control
of
the
cours
hi
life
will
take
.

nicol
project
a
quiet
intens
as
the
jitteri
yet
aggress
wife
and
her
perform
is
stunningli
effect
:
she
's
head
for
an
oscar
nod
.

the
movi
ha
some
help
from
a
similarli
strong
support
cast
,
at
the
head
of
which
is
director-cum-thespian
sidnei
pollock
,
enigmat
and
articul
as
harford
's
mysteri
friend
.

ey
wide
shut
is
not
perfect
:
the
last
hour
could
have
us
a
slightli
more
scissor-happi
editor
and
both
cruis
and
kidman
ar
too
good-look
for
me
to
believ
that
either
would
have
a
veri
strong
temptat
to
philand
.

still
,
thi
is
an
import
work
from
a
great
director
,
and
while
it
mai
not
be
on
par
with
some
of
stanlei
kubrick
's
best
it
is
a
worthi
final
film
,
a
complex
explor
of
jealousi
and
faith
.
