a
human
space
astronaut
accident
fall
upon
a
planet
rule
by
ap
.

he
is
taken
prison
along
with
some
other
human
,
and
tri
hi
best
to
escap
hi
simian
captor
.

oh
yeah
,
and
did
i
mention
that
the
ap
can
talk
?

kewl
!

critiqu
:
despit
thi
film
not
look
like
a
``
tim
burton
movi
''
or
it
lead
human
charact
show
ani
sign
of
be
a
human
be
himself
,
i
did
find
myself
gener
entertain
throughout
most
of
thi
film
and
do
recommend
it
as
fun
,
summer
fare
.

although
the
thing
that
set
thi
movi
apart
from
all
other
is
definit
it
incred
ap
make-up
job
and
character
.

i
mean
,
i
wa
complet
convinc
that
everi
singl
on
of
these
ap
wa
for
real
!

i
also
have
to
``
give
it
up
''
to
all
of
the
actor
insid
the
costum
,
not
onli
for
wake
up
at
three
in
the
morn
everi
dai
to
get
make-up
slobber
all
over
them
for
2-4
hour
,
but
for
come
through
their
costum
exterior
and
sell
us
their
charact
on
the
screen
as
well
.

i
especi
enjoi
bonham
carter
's
perform
,
who
i
believ
to
be
the
most
develop
charact
in
the
entir
film
-lrb-
human
or
ap
-rrb-
and
tim
roth
's
bad
gui
,
who
chew
up
sceneri
and
ooz
evil
in
everi
scene
in
which
he
took
part
.

plot-wise
,
i
like
the
begin
of
the
film
,
the
whole
build-up
onc
wahlberg
got
into
the
villag
,
the
escap
and
most
of
the
fight
scene
,
but
onc
thing
got
out
into
the
desert
area
-lrb-
and
the
final
battl
sequenc
-rrb-
,
i
kinda
lost
a
bit
of
my
interest
.

i
wa
much
more
intrigu
by
the
interact
between
the
charact
and
the
whole
idea
of
``
human
be
as
anim
''
then
i
wa
about
the
end
battl
sequenc
,
which
just
seem
a
bit
too
typic
for
thi
kind
of
film
.

i
also
hate
the
``
kid
''
charact
who
just
got
on
my
nerv
and
did
n't
realli
care
for
the
wai
that
the
battl
sequenc
wa
resolv
-lrb-
i
wo
n't
ruin
it
here
but
c'mon
gui
...
you
coulda
thought
of
someth
a
littl
more
plausibl
than
that
,
no
?
-rrb-
.

but
the
thing
that
held
thi
movi
back
more
than
anyth
els
wa
it
lead
charact
,
hi
cold
demeanor
and
the
zero
chemistri
that
he
share
with
either
on
of
hi
inter-speci
love
interest
.

thi
dude
did
n't
seem
to
give
a
rat
's
ass
about
anyon
but
himself
and
i
ultim
did
n't
realli
care
about
what
happen
to
him
either
.

now
i
'm
not
sure
if
thi
wa
the
fault
of
the
actor
or
the
script
,
but
the
film
suffer
becaus
of
it
.

visual
,
the
movi
wa
also
nice
to
look
at
-lrb-
especi
the
ap
!
-rrb-

,
but
i
definit
expect
greater
cool
from
tim
burton
.

the
``
surpris
end
''
that
highlight
the
origin
planet
of
the
ap
film
back
in
1968
,
felt
a
littl
tack
on
here
,
and
despit
be
interest
,
did
n't
realli
make
all
that
much
sens
to
me
-lrb-
unless
you
look
at
it
from
a
sequel
point
of
view
-rrb-
.

so
overal
,
i
love
the
whole
``
feel
''
of
the
planet
,
the
ap
that
rule
it
,
the
manner
in
which
thei
treat
the
human
,
scream
,
shout
and
revert
the
entir
evolut
chain
,
but
did
n't
appreci
the
film
's
lack
of
human
charact
develop
-lrb-
why
wa
kri
kristofferson
even
in
thi
movi
?
-rrb-

and
the
fact
that
it
lead
male
and
femal
human
were
just
plain
bore
.

but
i
would
still
recommend
thi
film
as
a
fun
,
summer
movi
with
laugh
,
creepi
and
a
realli
cool
premis
.

ps
:
for
anyon
who
ha
seen
the
origin
,
i
can
not
believ
that
thei
did
n't
at
least
bring
back
the
scene
in
which
the
lead
human
charact
-lrb-
in
thi
case
,
mark
wahlberg
-rrb-
goe
nut
at
the
world
in
which
he
's
suddenli
been
thrust
-lrb-
``
thi
is
a
mad
hous
!
''

-
type
of
thing
-rrb-
.

the
gui
in
thi
film
bare
seem
to
be
``
put
off
''
by
the
fact
that
he
's
surround
by
ap
who
can
speak
english
!!

where
's
joblo
come
from
?
