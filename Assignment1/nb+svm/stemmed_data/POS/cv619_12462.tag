,
with
a
superb

admittedli
,
i

somewhat
bias
in

,
sinc
thi

blast
me
into
my

and
the
lesser

that
i
possess
at

but
apart
from
the
nostalg
vibe
,
i
wa
still
extrem
impress
by
thi
film
,
as
it
continu
to
amus
me
,
despit
my
previou
dozen
or
so

.

thi

took
john

on
the
down
side
,
some
of
the
absolut
innoc
in
thi
film
might
bore
or
turn
peopl
off
-lrb-
like
when
sandi
sing
about
``

''
and
``
stai
out

''
with
danni
in
``
summer
night
''
-rrb-
,
and
the
plot
is
n't
exactli
the
most
elabor
stori-line
ever
creat
,
but
despit
these
small

,
thi

enough
great
music
and
high
energi
to
keep
anyon
amus
through
it
rapid
110
minut
run
time
-lrb-
and
believ
me
...
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
music
!!
-rrb-
.

make
sure
to
look
for
a
young
lorenzo
lama
in
the
static
role
of
the
brainless
footbal
player
,
as
well
as
the
nation
bandstand
danc
contest
as
on
of
the
film
's
absolut
highlight
.

and
do
n't
forget
to
bui
the
popular
soundtrack
afterward
,
so
that
you
could
listen
to
it
peppi
tune
