it
's
startl
to
consid
that
it
wa
onli
a
few
year
ago
that
film
distributor
would
worriedli
rearrang
their
summer
releas
schedul
in
order
to
give
the
annual
disnei
anim
featur
juggernaut
a
wide
berth
.

the
lion
king
had
just
crack
$
300
million
domest
in
gross
to
becom
on
of
the
most
profit
ventur
in
film
histori
,
continu
to
build
on
a
sturdi
base
left
by
prior
flick
aladdin
and
beauti
and
the
beast
.

sinc
then
,
though
,
disnei
's
anim
featur
have
shown
an
unbroken
string
of
diminish
return
,
with
pocahonta
,
the
hunchback
of
notr
dame
,
and
thi
year
's
hercul
success
prove
less
and
less
potent
.

with
the
onc
seemingli-impregn
disnei
stranglehold
on
the
market
share
suddenli
look
mighti
vulner
,
and
face
with
their
first
seriou
competit
in
the
anim
film
market
from
fox
's
anastasia
,
disnei
ha
brought
xma
home
earli
by
dust
off
the
featur
which
spark
the
modern
reviv
of
featur
anim
,
the
littl
mermaid
.

while
the
anim
for
the
film
is
,
as
is
typic
the
case
for
disnei
film
,
unquestion
top-notch
,
the
magic
in
the
littl
mermaid
is
not
it
anim
,
but
the
wonder
innoc
of
it
stori
and
it
rousingli
superb
music
.

the
film
's
storylin
is
fairli
straightforward
--
young
teen
fall
for
handsom
man
,
father
disapprov
and
assign
hapless
chaperon
to
hi
daughter
,
teen
disobei
father
and
goe
to
desper
length
to
win
her
man
--
except
in
thi
case
,
the
chaperon
is
a
crab
,
the
teen
is
a
young
mermaid
,
and
the
object
of
her
desir
is
a
human
princ
.

what
make
the
littl
mermaid
so
affect
and
so
emotion
reson
is
the
rich
and
charm
of
it
charact
and
the
sheer
clariti
and
honest
simplic
of
their
emot
.

from
the
moment
mermaid
ariel
lai
her
ey
on
princ
eric
,
she
's
resolut
smitten
,
and
she
's
such
a
pure
and
endear
charact
that
on
ca
n't
help
but
invest
their
heart
with
her
.

thi
simpl
but
touch
love
stori
,
coupl
with
a
healthi
dose
of
smart
humour
,
make
the
littl
mermaid
a
remark
captiv
pictur
.

on
of
the
interest
thing
about
the
littl

is
someth
which
now
curious

that

finest

as

,
novemb

ha
come
to
an
end
,
as
ha
disnei
's
limit
17-dai
re-releas
of
the
littl
mermaid
.

there
's
no
question
that
the
primari
motiv
for
,
if
not
the
film
's
reissu
itself
,
at
least
it
time
,
wa
to
reinforc
disnei

provid
direct
competit
to

new

anim
divis
and
their
first
major
ventur
,
anastasia
.

in
everi
respect
,
the
re-releas
of
the
littl
mermaid
appear
to
be
a
success
--
the
film
's
1997
gross
have
push
it
cumul
domest
gross
over
the
magic
$
100
million
mark
;
the
littl

prove
to
have
remark
strong
draw
power
for
a
film
initi
releas
onli
eight
year
ago
and
in
mani
home
on
video
,
pull
in
close
to
$
10
million
in
it
open
weekend
;
and
although
nobodi
could
possibl
expect
the
littl
mermaid
to
possibl
defeat
the
aggress-market
anastasia
in
head-to-head
competit
,
it
siphon
enough
from
the
fox
film
's
open
weekend
total
to
keep
anastasia
from
the
covet
weekend
leader
spot
,
allow
for
disnei
's
odiou
flubber
to
sweep
in
on
the
subsequ
week
and
wrestl
the
famili
demograph
market
share
awai
.

but
although
disnei
's
motiv
in
the
reissu
of
the
littl
mermaid
were
self-serv
and
protectionist
,
the
real
winner
is
the
public
.

ani
reason
to
put
thi
film
back
into
theatr
is
a
good
on
,
and
it
's
a
true
joi
to
see
thi
heartwarm
gem
back
on
the
silver
screen
.

the
littl
mermaid
is
the
best
film
to
come
out
of
the
disnei
's
modern
anim
renaiss
,
and
on
of
the
greatest
anim
film
ever
made
.
