kenneth
branagh
's
new
motion
pictur
had
to
compet
with
all
the
previou
frankenstein-film
made
throughout
the
year
in
almost
everi

,
includ
the
most

brannagh
ha
more
or

done
that
.

anoth
thing
is
charact
and
actor
.

branagh
ha
develop
everi
charact
and
assembl
a
magnific
cast

the
greatest
perform
come
from

that

he

.

at
first
he
is
like
a
helpless
,
abandon
child
,
desper
reach
out
for
love
.

later
when
he
read
frankenstein
's
journal
,
and
learn
that
he
is
compos
of
dead
bodi
,
hi
love
turn
into
rage
as
he
is
seek
reveng

he
is
capabl
of
kill
without
regret
.

``
i
took
him
by

and
lift
him
off

...
.

and
then
i

and
as
i

that
is
how
he
reveal
hi
savag
natur
to
hi
creator
.

and
yet
,
he
is
never
quit
evil
in
our
ey
and
hi
vaulerbl
and
hi
loneli
ar
palpabl
:
``
for
the

would
make

''

rare
ha
a
cinemat
interpret
of
``
the
daemon
''
approach
the
level
of
three-dimension
and
human
with
which
it
is
portrai
in
the
novel
.

anoth
vital
thing
is
the
charact
of
victor
frankenstein
.

in
most
of
the
previou
adapt
he
wa
simpli
a
mad
scientist
that
troll
the
graveyard
for
corps
and
then
creat
a
monster
-lrb-
god
know
why
!
-rrb-

with
the
power
of
an
electr
storm
.

almost
no
time
wa
grant
on
hi
charect
,
who
is
the
most
import
and
vital
charect
in
the
novel
.

here
,
branagh
introduc
the
charact
of
victor
frankenstein
,
establish
hi
obsess
with
the
veri
natur
of
life
and
death
,
set
up
the
intellectu
and
ideolog
conflict
between
victor
and
the
academ
establish
,
and
somehow
manag
to
build
up
to
a
rous
and
horrifi
creation
scene
.

branagh
plai
frankenstein
with
a
remark
understand
of
hi
charact
.

on
the
outsid
he
is
strong
,
ambiti
and
talent
scientist
,
but
deep
down
he
is
unsecur
,
fragil
and
vaulerbl
,
constantli
haunt
by
the
ghost
from
hi
past
.

helen
boham
carter
is
equal
wonder
as
frankenstein
's
surrog
sister
,
who
at
the
end
becom
hi
wife
for
a
littl
while
,
befor
death
drive
them
apart
.

the
rest
of
the
cast
,
plai
secondari
charact
,
is
solid
and
noth
less
than
convinc
.

visual
the
film
is
stun
-lrb-
especi
the
makeup
-rrb-
.

the
spin
camera
,
the
constantli
build-up
music
acor
,
the
art
direct
,
the
product
design
,
the
costum
ar
all
magnific
:
from
the
arctic
ocean
to
the
swiss
alp
and
dark
forest
,
to
the
plagu-riddl
street
of
ingolstadt
,
mari
shellei
's
frankenstein
is
a
wonder
to
behold
.

kenneth
branagh
direct
hi
film
as
if
the
script
wa
written
by
shakespear
:
''
.
.

all
i
onc
love
li
in
a
shallow
grave
...
.

by
my
hand
.
.
''
.

and
the
film
end
exacli
as
hamlet
,
when
the
creatur
set
both
hi
and
hi
creator
's
bodi
on
fire
.

the
film
end
with
frankenstein
and
hi
creation
burn
in
the
almost
hellish
fire
in
the
dark
.

and
a
terrifi
last
close-up
on
the
creatur
's
smile
face
.

can
a
man
creat
life
,
then
abandon
hi
creation
becaus
it
appear
horrifi
him
?

to
whom
ar
it
action
then
attribut
:
the
creatur
or
the
be
who
brought
about
it
exist
?

shellei
did
not
answer
these
question
,
but
she
certainli
pose
them
.

follow
her
exampl
,
branagh
doe
the
same
.

hi
film
is
a
tragic
saga
about
plai
god
.

victor
frankenstein
is
not
an
evil
man
.

he
want
to
chang
the
world
to
the
better
.

in
thi
he
repres
everyth
scienc
stand
for
:
act
without
doubt
,
never
consid
the
consequ
of
hi
action
.

produc
by
franci
ford
coppola
,
frankenstein
resembl
in
some
respect
coppola
previou
film
``
dracula
''
.

in
comparison
,
i
can
sai
that
``
dracula
''
ha
visual
that
even
``
frankenstein
''
can
not
live
up
to
.

but
when
it
come
to
stori
,
charact
and
cast
,
``
frankenstein
''
is
stronger
.

but
stronger
than
both
of
them
,
on
everi
aspect
,
is
neil
jordan
's
``
interview
with
the
vampir
''
.

although
the
film
is
not
perfect
-lrb-
the
camera
that
simpli
refus
to
stai
still
and
the
occasion
pushi
score
ar
at
time
more
tier
than
effect
-rrb-
,
these
minor
fault
ar
easili
forgiv
,
as
the
pictur
is
otherwis
captiv
and
stimul
.

branagh
ha
probabl
creat
on
of
the
best
-lrb-
if
not
the
best
-rrb-
adapt
of
shelli
's
classic
novel
.
