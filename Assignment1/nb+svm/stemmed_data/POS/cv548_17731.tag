8
mm
's
success
mai
hardli
be
surpris
.

it
wa
direct
by
joel
schumach
,
who
,
hopefulli
,
saw
thi
film
as
an
apolog
for
the
absolut
dread
batman
and
robin
.

befor
direct
the
last
two
batman
dud
,
howev
,
schumach
wa
respons
for
sever
well-made
horror
flick
:
lost
boi
,
flatlin
,
and
fall
down
.

mm
certainli
join
the
rank
of
these
minor
classic
and
is
perhap
most
reminisc
of
fall
down
in
that
both
film
present
an
averag
man
who
self-destruct
befor
the
audienc
's
ey
.

mm
wa
written
by
andrew
kevin
walker
,
who
also
pen
the
academi
award-win
thriller
seven
a
few
year
back
.

like
seven
,
mm
is
full
of
dialogu
which
haunt
you
well
after
leav
the
theater
.

well
is
search
for
answer
.

how
could
anyon
possibl
drug
and
then
slowli
,
method
,
sadist
kill
a
teenag
girl
to
make
a
film
?

when
confront
on
of
the
perpretr
at
the
end
,
the
murder
respond
that
there
ar
no
reason
.

he
just
enjoi
it
.

that
,
walker
seem
to
suggest
,
is
where
the
real
terror
lai
:
not
in
the
crime
itself
but
in
the
fact
that
ration
motiv
do
not
exist
.

a
coupl
minor
fault
led
me
to
my
four-star
rate
-lrb-
five
star
is
the
highest
rate
i
give
-rrb-
.

on
,
i
found
it
a
littl
difficult
,
earli
on
,
to
accept
the
fact
that
a
harden
privat
detect
would
get
physic
disgust
when
first
see
a
snuff
film
.

ye
,
snuff
is
a
horribl
thing
,
but
a
detect
of
well
'
calib
ha
probabl
encount
aw
thing
befor
.

second
,
some
of
the
clue
well
gather
ar
too
conveni
.

he
discov
,
for
exampl
,
the
victim
's
diari
in
her
privat
bathroom
,
despit
the
fact
the
the
polic
,
the
fbi
,
and
her
own
mother
have
all
investig
the
room
befor
.

final
,
the
close
scene
seem
trite
and
improb
consid
the
rest
of
the
film
.

despit
the
abov
critic
,
mm
is
an
engross
stori
.

on
of
the
best
scene
in
the
film
occur
toward
the
end
as
a
craze
well
,
who
no
longer
seem
like
a
hero
,
brutal
beat
on
of
the
pornograph
respons
for
the
snuff
film
.

he
pull
a
gun
on
the
man
and
,
for
a
rel
long
amount
of
time
,
struggl
to
decid
whether
or
not
to
kill
him
.

he
then
leav
the
build
and
call
the
victim
's
mother
,
in
the
middl
of
the
night
,
to
basic
see
if
she
would
support
the
action
.

the
entir
scene
is
tens
,
unpredict
,
and
emotion
charg
.

rare
,
anymor
,
do
horror
film
or
thriller
provok
suspens
in
me
asmm
,
with
scene
like
thi
,
did
.

8
mm
is
most
certainli
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
.

thi
is
a
graphic
,
oftentim
unflinch
,
look
into
the
dark
which
resid
in
both
ordinari
and
extraordinari
peopl
.

if
you
're
prepar
for
a
film
of
thi
natur
,
i
give
it
an
enthusiast
recommend
.
