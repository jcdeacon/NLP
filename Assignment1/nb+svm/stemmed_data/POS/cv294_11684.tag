plai
like
an

it
share
their

,
as
well
as
their

.

``
lebowski
''
ha
the
same
kind
of
craze
caricatur
that
made

;
and
it
ha
the
same
kind
of
cartoonish
look
and
feel
that
pervad
``

''

the
film
wa
shot
by
veteran

who
ha

''

deakin
alwai
give
the
coen
'
film
a
distinct
visual
style
,
and
here
he
doe
a
brilliant
job
of
captur
the
bright
color
of
seedi
lo
angel
in
the
earli
nineti
,
whether
that
by

if

'
most
restrain
effort
in
year
,
``
the

''
mark
their
return
to
over-the-edg
filmmak
.

it
is
overflow
with
style
and
attitud
,
which
help
make
up
for
the
scatter
plot
fragment
that
never
quit
come
togeth
in
the
end
.

the
coen
fill
the
screen
with
light
,
set
design
,
music
,
and
hilari
perform
from
all
the
lead

who
show

.

with
joel
direct
,
ethan
produc
,
and
both
write
,
the
coen
brother
seem
limitless
in
their
capac
to
turn
our
world
insid
out
.

their
talent
li
not
in
their
abil
to
reflect
the
norm
of
realiti
,
but
in
their
potenti
to
dig
out
the
darkest
corner
of
life
and
bring
them
to
light
.

the
coen
rejoic
in
the
oddbal
of
the

and
thei
put
them
center-stage
to
show
that
it
's
