it

due

becom

although

.

the
postman
ha
becom
a
symbol
for
hope
in
a
rube
goldberg
manner
.

although
the
movi
appeal
to
my
sensibl
,
there
ar
so
mani
thing
wrong
with
it
that
thei
can
hardli
be
count
.

it
's
derivit
of
costner
's
own
``
waterworld
''
and
clint
eastwood
western
.

there
's
littl
here
that
we
have
n't
seen
dozen
of
time
befor
.

the
film
is
often
down-right
corni
.

a
scene
where
the
postman
is
on
horseback
and
grab
a
letter
from
the
hand
of
a
bright-ei
child
is
embarrass
in
it
slow-motion
banal
.

the
film
's
final
few
minut
should
have
been
left
on
the
cut
room
floor
.

despit
the
film
's
excess
three
hour
length
,
sever
thing
ar
never
explain
.

what
wa
the
war
about
?

how
did
civil
chang
so
rapidli
?

everyon
ha
hors
:
where
did
all
thei
come
from
?

the
``
law
of
eight
''
that
bethlehem
live
by
seem
to
have
it
origin
somewher
beyond
the
film
,
but
where
?

ar
we
to
believ
that
the
rest
of
the
world
is
in
the
same
shape
and
ha
n't
made
their
wai
west
to
help
or
conquer
?

there
is
some
jumbl
symbol
here
that
doe
n't
appear
to
make
sens
.

the
tale
is
obvious
sai
that
commun
can
defeat
evil
in
much
the
same
wai
that
the
internet
ha
the
potenti
to
toppl
govern
,
but
beyond
that
there
ar
some
odditi
.

the
evil
armi
is
call
``
holnist
''
which
sound
coincident
like
the
new
ag
``
holism
''
,
but
why
?

is
it
anoth
coincid
that
it
take
place
in
2013
,
just
on
year
after
mani
ancient
prophesi
-lrb-
includ
the
end
of
the
mayan
calendar
-rrb-
predict
a
new
world
for
mankind
?

why
is
the
gener
name
``
bethlehem
''
?

there
seem
to
be
some
reason
for
that
,
but
what
?

sometim
the
movi
feel
like
a
joke
.

an
armi
of
postal
worker
arm
with
gun
?

consid
the
headlin
of
recent
year
,
it
take
a
tremend
leap
of
faith
to
cheer
for
these
gui
.

it
's
even
more
difficult
to
accept
those
re-power
the
feder
govern
as
the
hero
.

given
the
current
climat
of
the
countri
and
the
distrust
of
big
govern
,
it
's
ask
a
lot
for
the
audienc
to
get
behind
the
film
's
nation
.

even
with
it
numer
flaw
,
the
movi
all
come
togeth
,
if
onli
for
those
who
have
the
same
weak
that
i
have
.

it
's
doubt
that
``
the
postman
''
is
go
to
find
much
of
an
audienc
,
but
a
few
of
us
ar
go
to
have
a
good
time
.

besid
we
're
all
await
the
fall
of
civil
caus
by
the
year
2000
