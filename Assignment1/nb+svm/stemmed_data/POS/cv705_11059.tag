thei
discov
the
evil
potter
actual
ha

but
when

he
enlist
the
skill
of
extermin
jeff
-lrb-
mark
william

there
's
plenti
of
attent
to

,
especi
in
the
furnish
of
the
clock
famili
hous
,
made
out
of
lost
board
game
part
and
credit
card
.

the
background
detail
ar
nearli
as
rich
as
the
entertain
stori
.

the
variou
predica
of
the
clock
famili
ar
clever
and
thrill
.

base
on
an
origin
stori
,
the
screenwrit
did
a
good
job
at
imagin
all
the
potenti
and
unusu
peril
that
could
exist
for
a
4-inch
tall
person
.

as
the
villain
,
john
goodman
's
perform
veer
on
the
edg
of
be
over-the-top
.

but
hi
perform
suit
the
role
well
,
and
he
doe
veri
well
in
the
film
's
mani
slapstick
moment
.

with
a
nearli
seamless
mix
of
overs
set
,
bluescreen
shot
and
cgi
,
the
special
effect
in
the
borrow
ar
veri
well
done
.

there
ar
a
few
time
when
you
can
spot
the
effect
at
work
,
but
none
of
them
ar
so
jar
that
you
lose
the
suspens
of
disbelief
.

hopefulli
the
borrow

surpass
the
curs
of

,
for
it
is
surprisingli
entertain
and
fun
