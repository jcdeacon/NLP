it
's
tough
to
realli
sai
someth
nice
about
a
type
of
person
who
's
so
ethnocentr
that
ani
human
thei

is
now
gone
,
but
by
god
,
``
american

''
doe
it
,
and
for
that
,
i
commend
it
.

it
not
onli
take
ball
but
intellig
to
make
a
human
be
out
of
a
neo-nazi
skinhead
,
a
kind
of
person
who
dedic
their
live
to
hate
anyon
who
's
not
what
thei
ar
,
and
thi
film
wise
and
miracur
pull
it
off
.

the
subject
of
thi
film
is
on
of
them
,
but
he
is
wors
than
on
of
the
blind
follow
that
make
up
most
skinhead
member
sinc
he
is
the
leader
of
the
pack
.

he
's
the
on
who
instig
them
to
take
a
firm
grip
onto
their
rage
,
and
then
in
anoth
brilliant
stroke
,
justifi
it
with
polit
propoganda
that
make
eeri
sens
when
he
speak
.

he
's
so
utterli
convinc
as
a
public
speaker
and
so
firm
in
hi
convict
that
it
come
as
a
shock
when
he
actual
goe
through
the
rehabilit
process
.

hi
name
is
derek
vinyard
,
and
he
's
plai
by
edward
norton
with
so
much
fire
and
intens
that
when
he
speak
he
's
almost
as
convinc
and
arrest
a
public
speaker
as
,
sai
,
malcom
x
.

when
we
first
see
him
,
he
's
clean
shaven
,
with
a
jet
black
swastica
emrboid
on
hi
left
breast
,
a
devlish
goate
,
and
he
's
attack
the
black

outsid
of

in

hi
white
boxer
and
carri
a
handgun
in
hi
hand
that
never
seem
to
run
out
of
bullet
,
at
least
when
he
doe
n't
need
them
.

he
so
believ
in
hi
convict
that
he
's
will
to
put
hi
belief
to
the
test
,
even
if
he
know
it
will
mean
a
stop
in

if
onli
for

``

the

befor-and
in
all

,
we
get
a
portrait
of
a

a

the

circl
around
thi
,
then
spin
off
into
non-linear

,
all
done
in

we

and

``

a

scene
and

,
rather
than
a
cohes
,
great
film
that
flow
effortlessli
from
on

to
the
next
.

in
it
,
there
ar
some
of
the
best
scene
i
've
seen
all
year
.

on

featur
a
dinner
between
derek

,
a
jewish
liber
who
quietli
disagre

,
launch
the
scene
into
a
fit
of

that

unparal
emot
in

-lrb-
gould

to

is
unnerrv

anoth

to
build
a

and
a
nice
connect
between
derek
and
a
black
co-worker
-lrb-
gui

-rrb-
while
fold
laundri
in
prison
.

and
anoth
soon-to-be-classic
is
actual
divid
in
two
:
the
murder
of
the
two
black
men
that
wind
derek
in
jail
,
which
contain
a
final
murder
so
nasti
that
it
mai
be
the
most
revoltingli
shock
all
year
.

there
's
much
more
to
appreci
,
like
the
act
,
which
is
uniformli
good
,
with
stand-out
come
from
averi
brook
,
beverli
d'angelo
-lrb-
as
the
long-suffer
mother
-rrb-
,
and
gould
-lrb-
who
ha
on
horribl
line
,
but
other
than
that
,
come
off
with
the
best
perform
he
's
given
in
what
seem
like
a
realli
long
time
-rrb-
.

norton
walk
off
with
the
film
,
though
,
come
off
with
such
intens
that
he
reduc
anyon
not
do
an
adequ
job
to
rubbl
.

in
onli
the
fifth
movi
of
hi
career
,
norton
ha
invent
himself
as
on
of
the
most
reliabl
and
intens
actor
of
hi
gener
,
and
mayb
the
best
.

there
's
noth
like
it
when
norton
realli
get
roll
in
thi
movi
,
spew
out
line
with
such
author
that
he
command
all
attent
from
the
audienc
,
come
off
with
power
similar
to
that
of
a
young
maron
brando
.

that
he
allow
the
littl
emot
to
seep
through
is
amaz
.

sadli
enough
,
thi
is
n't
go
to
be
the
great
portrait
of
racism
that
it
perhap
hope
to
be
.

it
's
too
unambiti
and
even
a
littl
contriv
to
realli
take
off
as
either
a
power
statement
or
an
emot
masterpiec
.

the
end
,
especi
,
is
pencil
in
from
other
movi
,
toss
in
just
so
the
emot
keyboard
can
be
trounc
upon

some

-lrb-
which
wa
inevit
-rrb-
,
it
doe
n't
seem

even

doe
n't

as
such
,
on
can
see
why
the
director
,
toni
kay
,
want
to
have
hi
name
remov
.

sorta
.

``
american

is
a
veri
good
movi
,
and
i
wa
veri
move
by
it
,
but
it
could
be
a
lot
better
,
and
the
problem
seem
to
be
that
the
cut
as
it
is
is
not
up
to
what
he
claim
to
be
hi
potenti
.

somewher
,
he
claim
,
there
li
a
toni

cut

that
wa
to
be
the
true
cut
until
it
wa
view
by
norton
,
who
then
order
anoth
cut
,
and
that
is
thu
.

although
he
aim
for
the
direct
credit
to
go
to
``
alan
smithe
,
''
the
resid
name
for
ani
film
that
is
to
be
disown
by
it
director
,
it
wa
n't
allow
to
him
,
under
the
ground
that
onc
you
disown
a
film
,
you
can
not
badmouth
it
-lrb-
but
realli
,
that
's
the
macguffin-no
on
realli
want
a
film
thi
good
to
be
given
the
alan
smithe
sign
of
disapprov
-rrb-
.

kay
's
right
in
that
it
's
not
up
to
par
,
even
if
he
's
not
refer
to
normal
par
but
rather
hi
own
person
par
.

thi
will
not
be
a
``

for
the
late
90s
.

yet
it
still
get
it
point
across

back
it
up
with

-lrb-
it

at

when
