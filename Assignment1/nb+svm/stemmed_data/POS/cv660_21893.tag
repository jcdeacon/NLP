i
suppos
an
argument
could
be
made
that
toi
stori
is
on
of
those
film
that
did
n't
need
a
sequel
.

belov
by
kid
and
their
parent
,
respect
equal
by
mainstream
america
and
geekish
movi
buff
,
that
first
movi
remain
a
landmark
of
recent
histori
,
the
on
that
burst
open
the
possibl
of
comput
anim
and
demonstr
through
wild
invent
and
giddi
chutzpah
just
how
complac
the
disnei
anim
machin
had
becom
in
crank
out
fluffi
razzl-dazzl
entertain
full
of
formula
storytel
and
banal
songwrit
.

as
someon
who
doe
n't
believ
sequel
ar
necessarili
a
bad
thing
-lrb-
grant
,
thei
usual
ar
a
bad
thing
,
but
that
's
becaus
thei
're
made
for
the
wrong
reason
-rrb-
,
i
had
to
wonder
what
in
the
world
thei
were
think
.

fortun
,
disnei
claim
to
have
been
so
knock-out
by
earli
anim
test
that
thei
let
pixar
go
full-speed
ahead
with
a
theatric
sequel
.

lucki
thing
,
too

like
the
first

,
thi
on
is
a

to
behold
on
the
big
screen
,
and
technic
,
it
improv
on
it
predecessor
on
just
about
everi
level
.

-lrb-
from
a
busi
standpoint
,
the
end
credit
show
that
the
new
creation
ar
copyright
by
pixar
,
while
the
previou
film
's
element
ar
share
between
pixar
and
disnei
,
a
sign
of
the
product
hous
's
new
cachet
in
hollywood
.
-rrb-

visual
,
the
main
shortcom
of
thi
fulli
comput-gener
movi
is
that
human
figur
ar
still
render
rel
poorli
,
make
them
look
a
littl
creepi
.

fortun
,
that
eeri
unreal
fit
in
perfectli
with
the
perspect
of
the
movi
,
where
the
secret
world
of
toi
is
more
immedi
,
and
arguabl
more
attract
,
than
the
world
of
the
human
who
surround

there
's
somewhat
less

allow

excit

basi
,
and
more
philosoph
about

collector
,
the
natur

happi
and
the
mean
of
life
.

while
that
lead
to
fewer
bellylaugh
,
it
doe
make
wai
for
more
elabor
humor
and
an
uncommonli
ambiti
reflex
that
ask
the
toi
to
consid
their
own
statu
as
commod
that
move
in
and
out
of

.

-lrb-
just
do
n't
ask
why

base

where
els
in

do
you
get
such
an
awesom
moment
as
the
