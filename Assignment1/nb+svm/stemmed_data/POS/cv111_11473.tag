thi
look
like
a

neil
simonesqu
tale
with
mari
tyler
moor
bare
her

as
the
highlight
.

instead
it
turn
out
to
be
a
hilari
film
run
in
high
gear
from
begin

the

pedestrian
.

an

is
look
for
hi

parent
and
encount

charact
along
the
wai
.

the
movi
demonstr
just
how
far
a
good
script
and
actor
can
take
a
mundan
idea
.

the
son
and
hi
wife
take
off
on
the
search
accompani
by
a
woman
from
the
agenc
who
locat
hi

mexico
with
hi
real

without
give
you
a

to
recov
from
the
