the

we

go
's
wheel
turn

to
the
last
.

torontonian
pollei
-lrb-
of
the
sweet

-rrb-
refus

do
public
for
thi
pictur
on
the
basi
that
she
wa
``
not

''
her
turn
as
the
ill-fate
cashier
.

in
go
,
she
deliv
,
hand-down
,
her
best
perform
to
date
.

here
's
an
-lrb-
overr
-rrb-
actress
who
agre
to
appear
on
the
poster
,
but
not
support
her
team
at
the
junket
or
in
interview
;
thi
sort
of
arrog
is
commonplac
for
ms.
pollei
,
as
anyon
who
ha
read
of
her
polit
agenda
in
the
canadian
press
will
tell
you
.

if
she
doe
n't
want
to
be
the
ingenu
of
the
moment
,
she
should
have
said
``
no
,
''
not
go
.

but
i
digress
.

go
is
a
fun
film
,
so
chipperli
deprav
on
ca
n't
help
but
turn
off
hi
moral
judgment
for
it
durat
and
enjoi
the
ride
.

in
that
sens
,
it
's
a
departur
from
liman
's
last
film
,
swinger
,
which
at
least
lectur
against
self-absorpt
in
the
form
of
vinc
vaughan
's
trent
and
hi
subtl
comeupp
in
the
stori
's
clever
epilogu
-lrb-
which
ha
been
ap
by
mcdonald
's
for
their
latest
commerci
-rrb-
.

i
wish
i
care
more
about
go
's
charact
:
like
the
techno
music
thei
listen
to
,
the
band
of
anarchist
on
displai
here
ar
at
onc
absorb
and
vacuou
.

when
the
light
came
up
and
stung
my
ey
,
it
wa
difficult
to
recal
what
about
it
entertain
me
.

yet
entertain
me
it
did
.

go
is
light
and
frothi
,
featur
compel
if
not
endear
work
by
pollei
,
timothi
olyph
-lrb-
scream
2
-rrb-
,
and
especi
fichtner
,
whose
homoerot
behavior
is
milk
for
effect
laugh
.

fichtner
is
a
charact
actor
best
known
for
plai
backstabb
-lrb-
in
heat
,
armageddon
,
and
other
-rrb-
;
hi
previous

unlik
much
of
the
film
,
fichtner
is
unpredict
