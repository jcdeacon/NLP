?

will
tim
turn
chri
in
?

will
chri
turn
tim
in
?

will
thei
turn
themselv
in
?

all
of
these
question
were
run
through
my
mind
while
watch
thi
slick
suspens
film
.

the
event
in
the
curv
ar
veri
surpris
,
origin
,
and
fun
.

the
plot
sound
much
like
dead
man
on
campu
,
but
that
is
not
the
deal
with
thi
film
.

thi
film
is
a
veri
seriou
on
,
with
not
mani
laugh
.

there
ar
mani
twist
and
turn
that
make
thi
film
differ
from
most
film
.

the
end
in
particular
is
complet
unpredict
and
satisfi
.

it
is
a
terrif
,
suspens
end
that
i
could
never
predict
would
happen
.

hand
down
to
dan
rosen
who
wrote
thi
wild
ride
.

the
sound
realli
stood
out
in
the
film
.

it
is
quit
eeri
and
it
realli
add
to
the
feel
of
the
film
.

the
wai
the
movi
is
film
is
also
great
.

all
of
the
technic
aspect
,
as
well
as
the
act
and
direct
aspect
ar
veri
well
done
.

the
perform
in
the
curv
ar
veri
good
.

matthew
lillard
get
to
plai
anoth
creepi
role
,
just
like
in
1996
's
scream
.

-lrb-
a
+
-rrb-
he
is
veri
strang
in
thi
film
as
well
.

i
like
him
in
thi
sort
of
role
,
rather
than
the
role
he
ha
been
plai
in
comedi
such
as
senseless
and
she
's
all
that
.

michael
vartan
is
fantast
as
chri
,
who
ha
extrem
mix
emot
about
the
entir
murder
and
the
4.0
.

michael
vartan
wa
also
superb
in
never
been
kiss
,
where
he
co-star
with
drew
barrymor
as
a
teacher
who
fell
in
love
with
hi
student
.

keri
russel
also
give
a
great
perform
.

she
should
be
a
good
actress
in
the
horror
depart
of
the
film
.

tamara
craig
thoma
is
also
realist
,
especi
cope
with
the
death
of
her
boyfriend
.

some
veri
strong
support
perform
came
from
smaller
role
,
such
as
bo
dietl
and
anthoni
griffith
who
plai
two
detect
investig
the
case
.

the
bottom
line-i
might
just
have
to
curv
that
a-into
an
a.
*
note-the
curv
premier
at
the
sundanc
film
festiv
in
earli
1998
.

it
wa
decid
the
film
would
not
be
releas
