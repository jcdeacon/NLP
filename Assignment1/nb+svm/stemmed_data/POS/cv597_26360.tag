the

behind

the
result
wa
the

,
which
open
to
fairli
decent
review
in
london
in
1973
and

the
on

bit
of
knowledg
about

wa
that

it
seem
that
the

had
not
been

go
back
and
revisit
thi
film
after
ten
year
-lrb-
1990
be
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
it
-rrb-
,
it
is
amaz
to
me
that
thi
film
ever
got
made
or
ha
had
the
stai
power
that
it
ha
.

if
i
had
been
a
fox
execut
around
the
time
of
it
releas
,
i
do
n't
think
i
would
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
either
.

for
all
intent
and
purpos
it
is
a
bad
movi
-lrb-
though
bad
in
a
realli
good
sort
of
wai
-rrb-
,
but
sumptuou
product
design
and
a
great
deal
of
incred
catchi
song
realli
help
to
increas
the
likabl
of
the
film
.

by
the
time
the
credit
role
,
it
is
fairli
easi
to
have
gotten
wrap
up
in
the
film
and
it
charact
,
and
on
realli
get
the
feel
that
richard
o'brien
definit
wa
a
fan
of
the
old
cheesi
b-movi
hi
film
is
base
on
.

when
i
sai
that
the
wall-to-wall
song
ar
catchi
what
i
realli
mean
to
sai
is
that
,
onc
you
hear
them
,
thei
will
be
ingrain
in
your
head
for
all
of
etern
.

it
goe
without
sai
that
the
``
time
warp
''
is
the
most
popular
song
in
the
film
.

even
peopl
who
have
never
seen
the
movi
know
of
that
particular
song
.

what
those
who
have
n't
seen
the
movi
do
n't
know
though
,
is
that
there
ar
even
more
song
in
the
film
that
ar
just
as
worthi
of
acknowledg
.

my
person
favorit
is
``
over
at
the
frankenstein
place
''
,
but
``
dammit
janet
''
is
also
maddeningli
catchi
.

tim
curri
's
vocal
on
the
rock
tune
``
sweet
transvestit
''
need
to
be
heard
to
be
believ
.

the
final
of
the
film
,
a
big
floor
show
stage
by
frank-n-furter
and
featur
most
of
the
cast
in
garter
and
fishnet
-lrb-
includ

-rrb-

,
featur
no
less
than
four
song

``

``

,
``
wild
and
untam
thing
''
,
and
``
i
'm
go
home
''
-rrb-
,
all
of
which
ar
immens
singabl
.

the
film
's
true
popular
and
longev
resid
in
it
audienc
particip
though
.

despit
the
catchi
of
the
song
,
thi
movi
would
have
been
long
forgotten
about
if
it
had
n't
have
been
for
the
multitud
of
folk
who
dress
up
everi
fridai
or
saturdai
night
to
rush
out
and
be
a
part
of
