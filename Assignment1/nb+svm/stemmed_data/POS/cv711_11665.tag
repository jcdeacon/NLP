but
it
seem
that

the

dolor
driscol
-lrb-
gabriel
rose
-rrb-
,
is
a
kindli
woman
who
love
the
children
and
,
although
she
live
with
a
burden
of
guilt
,
is
not

the
bu
seem
to
have
simpli
slip
on
some
ic
,
and
there
wa
noth
should
could
do
to
prevent
it
.

howev
,
accord
to
stephen
,
there
ar
no
``
accid
''
in
life
,
and
someon
will
pai
for
thi
tragedi
,
whether
that
be
the
manufactur
of
the
bu
or
the
guardrail
the
bu
broke
through
.

he
goe
through
the
town
,
approach
the
parent
who
have
lost
children
,
ask
them
to
join
the
class
action
suit
and
find
vent
for
their
anger
.

and
,
for
hi
work
,
stephen
will
receiv
on-third
of
the
settlement
monei
.

howev
,
it
is
immedi
appar
that
stephen
ha
littl
or
no
interest
in
the
monei
.

he
is
driven
by
someth
els
,
someth
deeper
that
he
share
in
common
with
the
griev
parent
.

he
ha
lost
a
child
,
too
,
but
not
in
the
same
manner
.

hi
daughter
,
zoe
-lrb-
caerthan
bank
-rrb-
,
who
onc
almost
di
in
hi
arm
as
a
young
child
after
a
spider
bite
,
ha
been
in
and
out
of
drug
re-hab
clinic
and
detox
station
for
ten
year
.

she
call
him
on
an
irregular
basi
,
beg
him
for
monei
,
but
refus
to
tell
him
what
she
need
it
for
.

``
i
do
n't
know
who
i
'm
take
to
,
''
he
tell
her
.

in
hi
mind
,
hi
daughter
is
dead
.

the
lawsuit
is
,
to
stephen
,
not
onli
a
wai
to
mend
the
town
's
pain
,
but
also
hi
own
.

howev
,
not
everyon
in
town
want
it
to
happen
.

billi
ansel
-lrb-
bruce
greenwood
-rrb-
,
who
wa
drive
behind
the
bu
when
the
accid
happen
and
lost
two
children
,
want
noth
to
do
with
it
.

he
ha
alreadi
lost
hi
wife
,
and
he
buri
hi
grief
in
an
affair
with
a
marri
woman
.

he
doe
n't
want
to
talk
about
the
accid
,
and
he
see
the
lawsuit
as
noth
more
than
the
unnecessari
open
of
old
wound
.

to
him
,
the
town
should
be
abl
to
take
care
of
it
own
pain
,
and
it
doe
n't
need
outsid
like
stephen
get
in
the
wai
.

central
to
``
the
sweet
hereaft
''
is
the
tale
of
nicol
burnel
-lrb-
sarah
pollei
-rrb-
,
a
teenag
girl
who
dream
of
be
a
singer
befor
the
accid
turn
her
into
``
a
wheelchair
girl
,
''
as
she
put
it
.

asid
from
stephen
,
nicol
is
the
most
complex
charact
in
the
film
,
and
it
is
she
who
ultim
decid
the
fate
of
the
town
and
how
the
lawsuit
will
turn
out
.

it
is
also
her
sad
,
haunt
voic
that
we
often
hear
on
the
soundtrack
,
read
robert
brown
's
poem
about
the
pi
piper
,
and
how
when
he
led
all
the
town
's
children
awai
,
on
wa
left
behind
becaus
he
wa
crippl
.

obvious
,
nicol
is
that
child
,
and
she
feel
somehow
betrai
that
the
rest
of
the
town
's
children
left
her
alon
by
dy
in
the
wreck
.

her
situat
is
further
complic
becaus
she
is
involv
in
a
love
,
but
incestu
relationship
with
her
father
-lrb-
tom
mccamu
-rrb-
.

there
is
onli
on
,
fleet
scene
that
suggest
thi
relationship
,
but
it
is
somehow
ti
into
the
final
act
of
the
film
.

of
all
the
storylin
in
``
the
sweet
hereaft
,
''
thi
is
the
most
complic
and
unresolv
,
although
it
implic
stretch
throughout
the
entireti
of
the
film
.

egoyan
know
that
the
kind
of
question
he
bring
up
have
no
simpl
answer
--
if
ani
at
all
--
and
he
doe
n't
condescend
to
the
audienc
by
try
to
neatli
wrap
it
up
.

what
egoyan
ha
done
in
``
the
sweet
hereaft
''
is
realli
noth
short
of
miracul
.

in
hi
adapt
of
the
novel
by
russel
bank
,
he
ha
made
a
deepli
move
film
about
a
lawyer
by
transcend
the
petti
of
law
and
drive
headlong
into
the
deeper
mean
of
what
is
loss
,
and
how
piti
monetari
and
materi
possess
ar
when
compar
to
human
life
.

egoyan
ha
alwai
been
a
talent
,
but
distant
and
cerebr
filmmak
whose
work
suffer
onli
in
that
it
felt
so
cold
.

``
the
sweet
hereaft
''
is
quit
the
opposit
;
egoyan
's
stylist
and
narr
structur
work
brilliantli
to
heighten
the
impact
of
the
natur
emot
,
and
draw
the
audienc
into
the
tragedi
.

``
the
sweet
hereaft
''
seem
to
contain
the
combin
emot
impact
that
all
hi
other
film
lack
.

the
film
is
fill
with
beauti
,
subtl
perform
from
all
the
actor
,
especi
ian
holm
as
the
lawyer
and
sarah
pollei
as
the
sad
child
who
wa
left
behind
.

the
beauti
,
rove
camerawork
by
paul
sarossi
and
the
haunt
,
melod
music
score
by
mychael
danna
-lrb-
both
previou
egoyan
collabor
-rrb-
give
the
film
a
visual
and
aural
cohes
with
the
themat
element
.

like
hi
earlier
film
,
egoyan
weav
togeth
multipl
storylin
that
form
a
blanket
whole
.

he
work
with
time
as
a
fluid
substanc
,
shift
back
and
forth
between
the
past
,
the
distant
past
,
and
the
present
with
effortless
eas
.

the
actual
bu
wreck
itself
doe
n't
happen
until
midwai
through
the
film
,
but
by
that
time
the
event
ha
built
up
so
much
emot
that
egoyan
can
film
it
from
a
distanc
with
no
graphic
detail
,
and
still
have
it
carri
great
,
devast
weight
.

becaus
human
life
ha
becom
such
a
cheap
commod
in
movi
,
it
is
astound
that
egoyan
can
convei
so
much
heartbreak
in
such
simpl
,
direct
term
.

certainli
on
of
the
best
film
of
1997
,
``
the
sweet
hereaft
''
is
a
deepli
reward
,
mystifi
,
and
ultim
human
film
.
