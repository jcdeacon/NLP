the
stori
of

is
an

,
but
on
that
doe
n't

miss

is
the

``

subject
matter
,
creat
a
timeless

.

``
babe

should
not
have
rehash
these
theme
,
but
i
do
wish
it
would

thi

as
it
parallel
such
issu
as

and
so

but
thi
film
's
goal
ar
n't
as
lofti
as
the
first
's
,
instead
choos
to
take
a
more
straightforward
approach
,
allow
it

to
take

hoggett

is
what

of
what
i
see
as
the
differ

be
a
veri
good
film
and
the

``

is
a

from

sure
,
it
is
n't
a
great
film
,
but
it
is
an
excel

``

but
it
is
on

as

if

you
will
be
