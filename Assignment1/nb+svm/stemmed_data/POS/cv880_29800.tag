it
take
us
through
the
slow

complic
path
of
bereav

slow
is
the
best
descript
for
the
film
at
first
.

it
take
it
time
in
establish
the
habit
of
what
appear
to
be
a
normal

happi
famili

togeth

and
reprimand
the
kid
for
innoc
wrong
with
a
sigh
and
soft
pat
on
the
shoulder
.

you
get
the
feel
there
is

the

can
also
be

thi
can
be
