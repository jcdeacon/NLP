tarzan
is
not

much
a

about

well

regardless

can
:
pure

for

rather
believ

hei
,
tarzan

do
you

date

is

oh

i
do
n't

my
quot
anymor
.

tarzan
depart
from
the
usual
disnei
featur
in
that
thi
on
is
not
a
music
.

there
's
lot
of
music
to
be
sure
,
but
not
a
singl
charact
song
in
the
whole
hour
and
a
half
of
run
time
.

we
instead
get
more
of
a
phil
collin
concert
,
as
no
less
than
five
of
hi
origin
song
ar
us
as
interlud
materi
.

thi
is
n't
realli
a
bad
thing
,
as
the
song
ar
veri
high-energi
and
catchi
-lrb-
i
found
myself
sing
on
to
myself
for
most
of
the
follow
dai
-rrb-
;
it
's
just
differ
.

do
yourself
a
favor
and
see
thi
film
in
a
theater
with
a
good
sound
system
,
becaus
the
music
will
come
through
astonishingli
well
and
realli
enhanc
the
movi
.

with
each
new
featur
,
disnei
anim
get
even
better
.

not
necessarili
by
leap
and
bound
,
but
sinc
thei
put
out
a
new
film
each
year
,
a
steadi
rate
of
improv
is
appar
,
and
thi
definit
show
in
tarzan
.

there
ar
a
coupl
of
scene
where
the
anim
achiev
a
near
3-d
effect
,
and
a
number
of
scene
which
featur
tarzan
move
through
the
tree
ar

dizzi
.

the
wai
he
slide
down
tree
limb
and
trunk
is
veri
reminisc
of
skateboard
and
rollerblad
maneuv
,
and
had
me
think
thi
is
n't
just
tarzan
,
it
's
``
extrem
tarzan
.
''

howev
,
tarzan
doe
not
seem
to
have
what
i
call
it
``
chandeli
scene
,
''
which
is
the
on
scene
to
which
the
anim
have
chosen
to
devot
an
inordin
amount
of
effort
,
util
a
comput-assist
process
that
make
the
anim
absolut
breathtak

last
but
a
few

at
most
,
it
's
been
the

i
did
n't

even
a

but
when
terk
start

,
i
recogn
her

her

wa
fine
,
but
through
the
rest
of

i
kept
think
,
``
that
's
no
boi
ap
,
that
rosi

''

distract
to
sai
the
least
.

i
'll
admit
i
've
never
read
the
edgar
rice
burrough
stori
``
tarzan
of
the
ap
,
''
so
i
could
n't
tell
you
how
true
thi
film
stai
to
the
book
.

but
unless
you
're
a
purist
,
you
should
have
few
object
to
thi
film
.

with
solid
perform
,
action
,
adventur
,
a
bit
of
romanc
,
and
great
music
and
anim
,
tarzan
should
appeal
to
the
kid
and
to
the
kid
in
all
of
us
.

note
:
when
i
wrote
my
review
of
mulan
a
year

,
i
went
off
on
the
promot

merchandis
tie-in
preval
with

thi

i
'll
