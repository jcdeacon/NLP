base
on

popular
comedi
central

with

and

.

but
when
the

to

,
thei
learn
the
movi
is
rate
r

the

do
not

thi
,
and
thei
pai
a

>
from
here
on
,
noth
more
should
be
said
to
keep

surpris
.

but
believ
me
,
thi
is
n't
your
regular
south
park
tv
show
,
and
should
not
be
seen
by
anyon
under
14
or
more
.

thi
film
contain
extrem
profan
-lrb-
over
130
``
f
''
word
and
a
collect
of
other

.

but
beyond
be
bad
in
a
tasteless
type
wai
,
south
park
:
bigger
,
longer
and
uncut
ha
mani
messag
that
ar
embed
insid
it
.

but
i
bet
you
will
not
leav
the
movi
,
for
at
least
laugh
on
time
or
more
.

and
enjoi
yourself
.

take
it
from
me
,
south
park
:
b
,
l
,
and
u
,
is
n't
as
good
as
you
'd
hope
,
but
it
is
good
for
some
laugh
.
