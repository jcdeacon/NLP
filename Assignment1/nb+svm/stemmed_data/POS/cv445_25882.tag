argu
against

,
but
is

readi
to
lead
10,000

anoth
person

a

.

what
's
great
about
thi
film
is
that
it
is
made
as
if
hold
up
a
mirror
to
life
.

it
reflect
realiti
.

and
that
's
why
it
make
such
an
impact
.

edward
zwick
ha
creat
a
clever
,
well
written
and
terrifi
thriller
that
mai
veri
well
be
on
of
the
best
film
of
the
season
.

the
director
manag
to
tell
sever
stori
simultan
.

and
so
hi
film
plai
on
sever
level
,
never
loos
focu
on
it
main
object
.

he
is
explor
the
abus
of
power
,
the
distrust
relationship
that
exist
between
variou
segment
of
the
u.s.
govern
-lrb-
the
armi
,
the
fbi
,
and
the
cia
-rrb-
.

he
take
a
look
at
the
complex
inher
when
so
mani
secret
and
li
ar
involv
.

the
palestinian
commun
in
1998
new
york
is
treat
exactli
as
japanes
american
were
dure
world
war
ii
.

there
ar
concentr
camp
and
unlaw
inter
,
all
in
the
name
of
the
``
greater
good
.
''

in
the
latter
part
of
the
film
the
land
of
opportun
loos
it
heart
and
soul
--
freedom
.

wa
that
what
the
terror
!

ist
realli
want
?

thi
film
ha
evok
protest
and
object
from
the
arab-american
popul
in
the
u.s.
and
n.y.
especi
.

but
to
me
these
protest
seem
unnecessari
.

zwick
is
care
to
not
step
over
the
line
and
make
the
palestinian
typic
hollywood
bad
gui
.

the
script
is
therefor
wonderfulli
balanc
.

agent
hubbard
's
best
friend
and
loyal
colleagu
frank
haddad
-lrb-
toni
shalhoub
-rrb-
is
lebanes-american
.

and
it
is
quit
often
you
hear
line
such
as
``
my
first
boyfriend
wa
palestinian
.
''

thei
seduc
you
with
their
suffer
``
or
''
thei
love
thi
countri
as
much
as
we
do
.
''
''

but
no
matter
how
you
twist
thi
matter
,
you
wo
n't
get
awai
from
the
fact
that
when
it
come
to
world
wide
terror
it
is
arab-speak
popul
who
ar
in
the
great
major
.

more
to
the
point
,
the
sieg
demonstr
the
injustic
of
blanket
condemn
of
ani
ethnic
group
by
depict
the
unfair
treatment
of
all
arab-american
by
the
u.s.
militari
.

and
thu
thi
film
doe
not
serv
as
a
sourc
for
discrimin
in
ani
!

wai
.

denzel
washington
is
dash
as
alwai
.

in
thi
role
he
is
much
more
determin
and
stronger
than
usual
.

anett
bene
is
enjoy
and
believ
as
a
shadowi
cia
oper
who
prefer
espionag
,
a
network
of
snitch
and
seduct
to
gather
inform
.
.

bruce
willi
is
terrifi
as
the
sadist
,
hungri
for
power
,
that
never
loos
hi
connect
with
the
audienc
,
sinc
hi
point
of
view
is
not
too
hard
to
understand
.

the
film
is
elegantli
shape
.

the
scene
ar
easili
float
into
each
other
and
the
film
never
seem
overlong
.

zwick
know
exactli
how
to
provok
tension
,
horror
and
emot
and
doe
it
with
a
rare
observ
profession
.

he
tighten
the
intens
as
the
event
progress
.

and
when
a
plot
twist
come
,
it
actual
is
surpris
.

it
is
not
a
film
drain
in
patriot
,
like
the
work
of
roland
emerich
.

nor
is
it
a
film
that
portrai
explos
pure
for
entertain
valu
.

it
is
a
dare
pictur
that
ha
courag
enough
to
undertak
such
a
riski
stori
and
difficult
journei
.

it
ha
courag
enough
to
get
involv
in
polit
.

it
question
our
foreign
polici
,
mental
and
defens
.

i
must
admit
that
it
end
rather
disappoint
,
as
the
director
turn
the
patriot
wai
up
and
innov
down
.

but
despit
of
that
,
it
is
certainli
an
intellig
and
thrill
film
that
provok
emot
and
thought
;
a
virtu
that
few
summer
film
can
boast
of
.

``
thi
is
the
u.s.
armi
.
''

it
's
a
broadsword
,
not
a
scalpel
.

believ
me
,
you
do
not
want
us
in
an
american
citi
