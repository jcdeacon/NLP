what
happen
?

how
is
it
that
an

-lrb-

-rrb-
and
a
novel
-lrb-
_

contain

both

were

-lrb-
the

that
had
n't
been
fulli
form
yet
?

even
so
,
the
strength
of
_
elect
_
reli
upon
it
fantast
perform
from
broderick
,
witherspoon
,
and
newcom
jessica
campbel
,
as
paul
's
anti-social
sister
,
tammi
.

broderick
here
is
plai
the
mr.
roonei
role
from
_
ferri
bueller
_
,
and
he
seem
to
be
have
the
most
fun
he
's
had
sinc
then
.

witherspoon
is
a
revel
.

it
's
earli
in
the
year
,
it
's
a
comedi
,
and
teenag
have
littl
clout
,
but
for
my
monei
,
witherspoon
deserv
an
oscar
nomin
.

and
onc
campbel
's
charact
get
go
,
like
in
her
fantast
speech
in
the
gymnasium
,
then
you
're
won
over
.

on
thing
that
's
been
bother
me
sinc
i
've
seen
it
.

there
is
an
extraordinari
amount
of
sexual
in
thi
film
.

i
suppos
that
,
come
from
mtv
film
,
i
should
expect
no
less
...
but
the
film
start
off
light
and
airi
,
like
a
sitcom
.

as
the
screw
tighten
,
and
the
tension
mount
,
alexand
payn
decid
to
add
element
that
,
frankli
,
distract
from
the
stori
.

it
is
bad
enough
that
mr.
m
doe
n't
like
traci
's
determin
to
win
at
all
cost
,
but
did
thei
have
to
throw
in
the
student/teacher
relationship
?

even
so
,
there
's
no
logic
reason
why
mr.
m
ha
an
affair
when
he
doe
.

there
's
a
lot
to
like
in
_
elect
_
,
but
the
plot
similar
to
_
rushmor
_
,
and
the
tonal
nosed
it
take
as
it
get
explicitli
sex-driven
,
mark
thi
as
a
disappoint
.
