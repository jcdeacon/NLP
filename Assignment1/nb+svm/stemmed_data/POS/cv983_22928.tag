r.
few
film
in
1999
have
divid
the
critic
consensu
as
sharpli
as
alan
parker
's
adapt
of
frank
mccourt
's
memoir
angela
's
ash
.

mani
dismiss
it
as
an
humorless
,
sentiment
,
uninterest
version
of
the
huge
popular
novel
;
other
hail
it
as
a
heartfelt
,
sincer
portrait
of
the
human
spirit
.

i
'm
somewher
in

lean
strongli

.

it
's
certainli
well-made
and
it
never
becom
tediou
like
some
literari
adapt
have
a
tendenc
to
be
.

but
i
have
a
feel
that
parker
fill
the
movi
with
pseudo-lyric
shot
of
rain
fall
on
the
home
street
of
ireland
just
so
it
can
have
the
two-and-a-half
hour
run
time
that
scream
``

also

the
film
's
final
messag
is
somewhat
conflict
,
as
franki
,
in
effect
,
leav
hi
famili
famish
in
ireland
while
he
himself
goe
back
to
america
.

what
,
exactli
,
ar
we
suppos
to
make
of
that
?

hi
mother
doe
n't
seem
to
mind
becaus
she
want
the
best
possibl
futur
for
her
son
,
as
ani
mother
would
,
but
it
still
seem
inconsider
of
him
.

i
have
n't
read
the
book
,
but
i
'm
sure
that
mccourt
justifi
hi
action
therein
;
therefor
,
i
'm
suspici
.

anoth
thing
that
's
never
made
clear
in
the
movi
is
the
mean
of
the
titl
,
which
,
i
'm
sure
,
is
also
explain
in
the
memoir
.

if
seen
as
a
film
onto
itself
,
rather
than
an
adapt
,
angela
's
ash
stand
tall
.

despit
a
few
minor
setback
,
it
is
a
captiv
stori
of
peopl
forc
to
live
in
the
trench
by
an
merciless
societi
where
those
of
weaker
charact
ar
shove
to
the
bottom
