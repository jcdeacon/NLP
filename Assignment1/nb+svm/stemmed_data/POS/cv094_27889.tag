myself

with
the
passag
of
a
few
hour
i
temper
my
enthusiasm
and
start
ponder
the
question
of
whether
a
masterpiec
must

be

piec
of

viceversa

a
matter
of

i
avoid
a
commit
by

as

a
masterpiec
is
ani

embodi
the
skill
of
a

as
such
it

the

in
an
ideal
world
of
orient
folklor
,
with
the
requisit
blend
of
legend
,
fantasi
,
magic
and
mytholog
.

it
is
reminisc
of
a
wagnerian
epic
with
charact
which
might
as
well
be
half-god-greater
than
life
,
purer
than

,
stronger
than

,
physic

and
abl

accomplish

but
with
a
human
soul
that
make
them
ultim

all
the
classic
element
of
the
orient
mystiqu
ar
thrown
into
the
mix
,
includ
the
art
of
contempl
and
the
concept
of
martial
dexter
as
the
physic
equival
of
spiritu
advanc
.

the
classic
struggl
between
good
and
evil
is
the
inevit
backdrop
,
with
advanc
master
of
each
and
a
golden
pupil
,
which
must
choos
between
the
two
.

it
is
the
gift
pupil
who
,
under
the
influenc
of
the
evil
master
steal
the
holi
grail
in
the
form
of
a
magic
sword
which
is
the
focu
of
the
conflict
at
the
heart
of
the
legend
.

the

the
paradox

there
need
