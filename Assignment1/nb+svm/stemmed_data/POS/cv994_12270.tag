critiqu
:
ever
wonder
what
would
happen
if
your
better
half
turn
out
to
be
someon
other
than
the
person
that
you
had
come
to
cherish
and
love
?

well
,
if
you
ever
have
,
then
thi
film
is
definit
for
you
.

it
is
n't
the
most
origin
premis
in
the
world
,
but
it
is
handl
pretti
well
here
,
and
pretti
quickli
for
that
matter
-lrb-
a
speedi
90
minut
-rrb-
.

i
think
on
of
the
main
reason
thi
film
work
for
me
is
the
groundbreak
perform
by
mark
wahlberg
-lrb-
of
boogi
night
infami
-rrb-
.

he
complet
captur
all
the
good
,
and
bad
,
of
the
main
charact
of
thi
film
,
and
alwai
kept
me
want
to
see
more
and
more
of
him
-lrb-
hi
perform
score
him
a
solid
nomin
from
hi
core
target
audienc
,
as
``
best
villain
''
at
the
1997
mtv
movi
award
-rrb-
.

the
soundtrack
is
also
veri
effect
in
thi
set
,
and
of
cours
,
the
slutti
perform
by
alyssa
milano
is
someth
we
could
all
indulg
in
-lrb-
look
for
the
nice
bikini
and
butt
shot
...
if
you
're
into
that
kind
of
thing
,
that
is
:-rrb-
.

i
did
n't
much
care
for
the
father/david
relationship
which
seem
to
be
a
littl
too
contriv
,
but
for
the
most
part
,
i
wa
realli
into
thi
movi
.

then
again
,
daddi
dearest
did
have
on
of
the
coolest
line
in
the
movi
when
hi
wife
is
ask
him
what
the
``
big
deal
''
wa
about
hi
daughter
date
david
.

hi
repli
:
``
the
big
deal
is
that
the
gui
give
me
the
creep
,
and
the
girl
is
my
daughter
.
''

good
point
.

all
in
all
,
the
movi
kick
some
fun
ass
,
mindless
as
it
wa
,
and
effect
demonstr
everi
parent
's
worst
nightmar
.

mind
you
,
i
still
ca
n't
tell
if
rees
witherspoon
is
good
look
or
a
douchebag
,
but
hei
,
life
goe
on
.

and
on
a
person
note
,
we
final
decid
to
add
some
taco
meat
onto
our
nacho
fiesta
of
usual
,
and
let
me
tell
you
all
...
it
wa
a
flame
success
!!
