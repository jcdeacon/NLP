anoth
predica

just
like
love
itself
,
thi
movi
is
distinct
and
appreci
by
all
on
mani
differ
level
.

the
actor
in
thi
film
ar
all
also
veri
,
veri
good
.

sean
conneri
is
solid
as
the
older
man
with
some
issu
to
resolv
,
as
is
gena
rowland
,
as
the
ag
wife
with
trepid
.

joli
come
out
of
thi
film
a
star
with
a
great
perform
,
while
philipp
is
as
pretti-boi
as
ever
.

anderson

with
her
wonder
portray
of
a

try
to
re-ignit
her
love
life
,
opposit
a
surprisingli
admir
perform
by
former
talk-show
host

jon
stewart
.

even
denni
quaid
manag
to
step
outsid
of
hi
overact
shoe
in
thi
film
,
and
offer
a
convinc
show
of
a
man
lost
within
hi
own
imagin
.

the
onli
piec
of
thi
puzzl
which
left
me
somewhat
detach
,
wa
the
part
surround
jai
mohr
,
the
man
dy
from
aid
,
and
hi
mother
,
ellen
burstyn
.

the
actor
were
fine
,
but
somehow
,
the
piec
seem
out
of
place
within
the
realm
of
everyth
els
.

the
end
of
thi
film
wa
also
a
littl
too
saccharin
for
me
,
but
i
guess
that
's
just
hollywood

in
concept
and
style
,
but
it
complet
anthesi
in
regard
to
charact
relat
and
like
.

the
charact
in
those
film
were
too
uniqu
and
inhuman
for
anyon
to
care
,
as
oppos
to
thi
film
,
which
offer
rich
and
believ
charact
,
live
real
live
and
talk
about
real

all
in
all
,
thi
movi
offer
mani
interest
charact
,
talk
and
live
genuin
and
engag
love
live
,
wonder
perform
by
it
solid
cast
,
too
sweet
of
an
end
,
but
an
enjoy
and
rewatch
movi
nonetheless
.
