kevin
smith
is
like
a
big
kid
.

hi
humor
is
that
of
a
sophist
juvenil
's
.

he
grew
up
idol
star
war
and
love
comic
book
,
have
also
written
a
few
.

he
also
ha
a
cult
follow
,
mostli
compos
of
teenag
,
colleg
student
,
and
smith
's
own
fellow
adolesc-mind
grownup
.

smith
is
hilari
in
person
and
in
write
,
but
when
he
tri
to
be
earnest
and
moral
,
that
is
when
he
goe
wrong
.

kevin
smith
is
a
better
writer
than
director
,
and
he
'll
be
the
first
to
tell
you
that
.

that
might
also
be
part
of
the
reason
why
hi
moral
come
across
as
so
heavi-hand
.

great
director
show
us
their
these
instead
of
have
the
charact
sermon
them
.

thi
wa
true
in
the
overr
chase
ami
,
and
it
is
true
for
dogma
as
well
.

that
is
not
to
sai
smith
's
messag
is
a
bad
on
.

in
dogma
,
smith
tell
us
that
problem
aris
when
peopl
believ
beyond
ani
doubt
that
their
insight
into
god
and
god
's
desir
is
superior
to
anyon
els
's
.

basic
,
dogmat
is
bad
.

chang
the
mind
of
the
dogmat
is
virtual
imposs
,
and
sinc
the
dogmat
believ
that
thei
have
special
insight
,
thei
also
know
what
is
best
for
you
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.

thi
is
not
exactli
a

in

but
i
have
no
problem
with

prove
smith
's

smith
's
own
problem
with
deliv
thi
messag
is
that
he
beat
us
over
the
head
with
it
like
we
ar
read
a
dogma
for
dummi
book
.

but
thi
is
smith

person
,
and
hi

prove
to
be
the
behind-the-scene
manipul
for
all
the
chicaneri
.

the
logic
but
convolut
plot
onli
exist
as
an
excus
for
the
joke
and
to
make
smith
's
point
,
and
in
itself
,
ha
littl
dramat
momentum
.

among
the
supposedli
outrag
claim
made
by
the
film
is
that
god
is
a
woman
,
jesu
wa
black
,
and
the
bibl
wa
written
by
a
bunch
of
racist
,
misogynist
white
men
.

of
cours
,
kevin
smith
doe
not
necessarili
subscrib
to
these
idea
himself
.

thei
ar
a
metaphor
for
the
fear
and
insecur
of
the
dogmat
.

smith
sai
as
much
in
hi
amus
disclaim
that
preced
the
movi
.

when
harvei
weinstein
ask
smith
to
put
it
into
the
film
befor
cann
,
smith
thought
it
might
give
valid
to
protest
'
claim
that
the
film
wa
sacrilegi
,
but
then
he
rethought
it
and
turn
the
disclaim
into
a
joke
.

the
film
's
humor
is
uneven
.

some
part
ar
veri
funni
as
when
bethani
goe
for
a
fire
extinguish
when
metatron
make
a
burn-bush
kind
of
entranc
.

but
mani
of
the
film
's
joke
just
bomb
,
as
in
virtual
anyth
involv
salma
hayek
's
serendip
.

also
,
some
of
the
joke
can
be
seen
come
from
a
mile
awai
.

still
,
smith
keep
the
zinger
come
at
a
suffici
rapid
pace
.

among
the
actor
,
fiorentino
and
rickman
stand
out
by
far
.

fiorentino
virtual
by
herself
give
the
film
emot
weight
.

damon
and
affleck
ar
fairli
lacklust
.

rock
and
hayek
exist
in
the
film
pretti
much
onli
as
comic
relief
as
ar
mew
and
smith
.

but
the
latter
duo
fare
much
better
becaus
jai
and
silent
bob
,
who
recur
in
all
of
smith
's
movi
,
ar
much
more
in
line
with
smith
's
brand
of
humor
.

bud
cort
,
georg
carlin
,
janean
garofalo
,
guinever
turner
,
and
alani
morissett
all
make
cameo
appear
