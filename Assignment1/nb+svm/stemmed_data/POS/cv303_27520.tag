the
perform

from

who

slowli
envelop
the

their

,
the
disappear
of

at
the
30-minut

divulg
the
movi
's
true
intent
and
transform
the
proceed
into
a
taut
,
at
time
frighten
,
horror-mysteri
.

at
the
center
of
the
film
is
the
except
cate
blanchett
-lrb-
1999
's
``
the
talent
mr.
riplei
''
-rrb-
,
who
turn
anni
wilson
from
what
could
have
been
littl
more
than
a
run-of-the-mill
protagonist
into
a
veri
exact
,
down-to-earth
,
realist
person
with
valid
troubl
and
a
care
attitud
toward
those
around
her
.

blanchett
take
the
unextraordinari
materi
and
run
with
it
,
give
the
entir
film
a
truli
classi
aura
that
it
otherwis
might
not
have
had
.

we
follow
her
at
everi
turn
becaus
she
is
so
mesmer
,
both
as
a
charact
and
an
actress
.

blanchett
is
n't
the
onli
bright
perform
,
as
she
is
abli
support
by
on
of
the
best
cast
of
the
year
.

in
her
first
role
follow
her
oscar
win
for
1999
's
``
boi
do
n't
cry
,
''
hilari
swank
is
excel
as
the
confus
valeri
,
who
seek
guidanc
from
anni
,
but
is
too
scare
to
take
her
biggest
advic
of
all
:
to
leav
the
grossli
abus
donni
.

as
donni
,
keanu
reev
-lrb-
2000
's
``
the
watcher
''
-rrb-
make
an
utterli
convinc
backwood
meani
,
so
much
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
believ
he
is
an
actor
at
all
.

for
the
often-critic
reev
,
whose
act
abil
have
never
been
the
best
,
thi
is
the
biggest
compliment
he
could
possibl
get
,
and
it
is
also
on
of
the
better
perform
he
ha
given
.

giovanni
ribisi
-lrb-
2000
's
``
the
boiler
room
''
-rrb-
is
heartbreak
as
a
mental
slow
young
man
who
see
anni
as
hi
onli
friend
,
and
want
her
to
do
noth
but
help
him
understand
why
he
is
be
plagu
by
bad
dream
about
hi
dad
.

in
the
small
,
but
pivot
role
of
the
sleazi
jessica
king
,
kati
holm
-lrb-
2000
's
``
wonder
boi
''
-rrb-
ha
turn
in
yet
anoth
stun
support
turn
.

her
promiscu
role
of
jessica
is
on
she
ha
never
plai
befor
,
and
she
is
radiant
in
her
few
scene
.

final
,
kim
dicken
-lrb-
2000
's
``
hollow
man
''
-rrb-
make
her
usual
strong
impress
as
anni
's
spici
best
friend
,
linda
.

the
other
notabl
aspect
of
``
the

''
is
it
moodi
atmospher
that
lai
such
a
thickli
forebod
air

it
