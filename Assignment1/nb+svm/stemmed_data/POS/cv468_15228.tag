when
cast
the
kei
part
of
the
voic
of
mose
,
most
peopl
's
first
candid
would
probabl
not
be
the
controversi
actor
val
kilmer
-lrb-
the
saint
and
the
island
of
dr.
moreau
-rrb-
,
but
he
wa
dreamwork
's
choic
in
their
first
tradition
anim
movi
,
the
princ
of
egypt
.

the
select
of
kilmer
prove
to
be
a
wise
on
,
but
the
biggest
risk
dreamwork
took
wa
n't
in
the
cast
depart
.

the
radic
departur
wa
that
thei
decid
to
us
the
medium
of
anim
to
make
a
biblic
epic
,
a
la
cecil
b.
demil
,
to
move
our
heart
and
mind
rather
than
to
tickl
our
funni
bone
.

in
the
press
kit
produc
pennei
cox
sai
that
thei
want
to
make
a
film
for
adult
base
on
sophist
theme
but
on
that
did
not
exclud
children
.

anim
movi
for
adult
that
ar
appropri
for
kid
and
that
ar
not
comedi
,
now
that
is
someth
fresh
.

let
me
admit
up-front
that
i
wa
quit
skeptic
as
to
whether
dreamwork
could
pull
it
off
.

dreamwork
's
antz
seem
to
be
a
movi
not
quit
appropri
for
ani
ag
group
.

the
princ
of
egypt
mai
be
harder
to
market
than
antz
,
but
it
is
much
more
satisfi
.

like
antz
and
unlik
the
more
modest
cast
of
pixar
's
a
bug

the
princ

the

which
is

is
a

at
less
than
half
of

the

rush
through
so
much
materi
that

we

he
see
for
the
first
time
the

after

mose
come
back
to
ask
rams
to
let

thi
lead
to
the
classic
scene
of
the
part

even
