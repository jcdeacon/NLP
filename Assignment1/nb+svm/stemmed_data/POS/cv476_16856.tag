the
time

becam
the
cinemat

for

reason
the

becam
the

in

literatur-the
fantast
concept
wa
a
brilliant
wai
for
the
author
to
talk
about

for
h.g.
well
it

for

,
who
produc

it

the
constant
and
more
immin
threat
of

underlin
with
the
neg
refer

throughout

even
the
modern
audienc

which
would
be
tempt
to
discard
the
film
as
old-fashion
,
could
find
some
valu
in
it
univers
messag
,
fit
for
each
era
.

compar
with
the
genr
film
of
todai
,
the
time
machin
is
even
better
,
and
could
serv
as
a
good
exampl
how
to
make
intellig

thought-provok
film
.

of
cours
,
sinc
thi
is
hollywood
product
after
all
,
the
time

deliv
such
concept
in
the
form
of
classic
adventur
,
sometim
sacrif
plausibl
for
the
sake
of

for
exampl
,
it
is
hard
to
imagin
that
someon
would
be
abl
to
understand
perfect
english
million
year
in

;
same
is
with
morloc
degener
into
mutant
monster
,
while
eloi
remain
undistinguish

the
peopl
of

some
of
the
final
scene
,
that
turn
victorian
scientist
into
an
action
superhero
,
ar
also
rather
unconvinc
.

but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
film
is
veri
well
direct
,
cleverli
pace
and
the
special
effect
,
although
definit
old-fashion
,
ar
more
than
adequ
for
thi
kind
of
pictur
.

the
act
is
good
,
with
rod
taylor
in
on
of
hi
most
rememb
role
,
while
in
the
same
time
alan
young
bring
rather
memor
perform
as
georg
's
trust

filbi
.

yvett
mimieux
,
who
plai
weena
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
be
rememb
more
by
her
look
than
by
the
complex
of
her
role
.

howev
,
despit
all
those
flaw
,
the
time

is
a
veri
good
