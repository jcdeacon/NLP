and
the

face
a
two-fold
challeng
--
not
onli
somehow
resurrect
riplei
,
but
also
rescu
thi
onc-profit
seri
from
the
scrap
heap
.

even
if

writer
joss
whedon
devis
a
quick
,
easi
,
and
painless
answer
to
the
dead
riplei
problem
--
clone
her
,
which
is
what
shadi
militari
scientist
do
us
some
blood
left
behind
on
fiorina
161
,
the
prison
planet
of
the
third
film
.

that
done
,
the
_
real
_
challeng
present
itself
--
what
do
with
her
.

alien
introduc
riplei
as
smart
and
resourc
;
alien
simultan
toughen
her
up
and
made
her
more
vulner
,
explor
her
matern
side
;
alien3
saw
her
undergo
the
seven
stage
of
death
.

what
could
be
next
?

whedon
come
up
with
a
clever
spin
:
sinc
the
origin
riplei
di
while
impregn
with
an
alien
queen
,
the
blood
us
for
the
clone
is
also
``
infect
''
with
alien
dna
.

so
the
new
riplei
is
,
inde
,
new
--
a
human/alien
hybrid
bless
with
heighten
instinct
and
strength
,
a
psychic
bond
with
the
deadli
speci
,
and
a
more
predatori
attitud
.

unfortun
,
that
is
where
alien
resurrect
's
clever
streak
in
write
stop
.

the
alien
seri
is
known
for
have
stronger
stori
than
most
creatur
featur
.

but
the
stori
in
resurrect
is
more
of
an
afterthought
.

the
movi
begin
with
a
plot
involv
some
militari
type
attempt
to
train
alien
to
do
their
bid
,
but
onc
the
creatur
break
free
,
it
is
onc
again
riplei
and
a
ragtag
crew
-lrb-
thi
time
a
bunch
of
interstellar
smuggler
,
includ
tough
waif
call
,
plai
by
a
game
winona
ryder
-rrb-
try
to
extermin
them
.

and
the
alien
riplei
scenario
is
ultim
not
exploit
to
it
full
potenti
;
i
would
have
like
deeper
explor
into
the
quandari
of
becom
on
of
the
speci
she
ha
spent
her
entir
life
try
to
destroi
.

while
the
settl
into
tri-and-true
formula
is
a
littl
disconcert
,
the
formula
is
tri-and-true
for
a
reason
,
and
jeunet
tackl
the
proceed
with
giddi
abandon
.

the
alien
,
after
all
these
year
,
is
still
terrifi
,
and
a
new
breed
that
is
introduc
is
no
less
so
.

the
violenc
is
appropri
grisli
and
extrem
,
and
the
action
set
piec
ar
suspens
and
excit
,
most
notabl
an
extend
underwat
sequenc
.

the
film
is
absolut
mesmer
visual
,
thank
to
the
solid
work
done
by
product
design
nigel
phelp
and
cinematograph
dariu
khondji
.

as
technic
adept
as
jeunet
's
direct
is
,
perhap
hi
-lrb-
and
,
for
that
matter
,
whedon
's
-rrb-
greatest
contribut
is
the
infus
of
humor
into
thi
notabl
downbeat
and
seriou
seri
.

a
sens
of
humor
mai
seem
to
go
against
everyth
thi
horror
show
stand
for
,
but
the
self-awar
of
the
excess
just
add
to
the
fun
.

no
,
alien
resurrect
is
not
the
great
film
that
ridlei
scott
's
alien
or
the
even
greater
film
that
jame
cameron
's
alien
wa
.

but
after
the
dauntingli
slow
gloom
and
doom
of
fincher
's
alien3
,
jeunet
's
resurrect
is
a
welcom
return
to
it
root
as
a
wild
,
reckless
thrill
ride
.

that
is
what
made
the
alien
seri
so
popular
in
the
first
place
,
and
that
is
what
will
keep
the
seri
popular
in
ani
futur
instal
.
