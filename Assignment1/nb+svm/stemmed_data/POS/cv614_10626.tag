had
better
watch
hi
back
--
there
's
a
new
critter
in
town
,
and
he
's
the
nameless
anim
attract
of
``
mous
hunt

''
dreamwork
skg
's
clever
first
forai
into
famili
fare
.

although
it
run
out
of
steam
toward
it
end
,
thi
live-action
comedi
still
boast
enough
energ
slapstick
and
invent
set

to
best

...
but
consid
that
list
includ
dismal
tripe
like
``
air
bud
,
''
``
flubber
''
and
``
that
darn
cat
,
''
and
it
's
realli
not
such
a
difficult
feat
to
pull
off
.

still
,
throw
the
two
rodent
in
a
box
arena
,
and
i
'll
be
hope
that
the
mous
from
``
mous
hunt
''
knock
some
sens
back
into
mickei

the

``

even
some
of

can
be
grim

but
it
's

the
star
of
the

evan

is
funni
stuff
,
too

and
hold
it

in

a
