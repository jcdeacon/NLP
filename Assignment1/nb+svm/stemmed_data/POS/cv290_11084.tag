we
've
final
figur

thi
almost
univers
belief
is
the
both
the
strength
and
weak
of
director
steven

's
latest

from
their
home
on
africa
's
west
coast
to
cuba
to
be
sold
into
slaveri
.

fifti-three
of

so
thei

.

instead
the

head
up
the

to
the

.

the

see

much
like

''
-lrb-
which
follow
``

''
as
thi
follow
``

''
-rrb-
,
the
moral
side
ar
not
difficult
on
to
choos
.

nazi
and
slave
trader
:
both
treat
group
of
other
as
less
than
human
.

it
's
not
hard
to
see
who
the
bad
gui
ar
.

without
that
question
to
ponder
,
the
director
's
job
is
more
difficult
.

he
ha
to
make
the
stori
interest
.

spielberg
succe
for
the
most
part
.

the
visual
aspect
of
the
film
is
beyond
reproach
.

where
the
movi
fall
down
is
a
bit
more
subtl
.

there
ar
veri
few
_
peopl
_
in
the
tale
.

in
fact
,
cinqu
is
the
onli
charact
who
is
flesh
out
.

tappan
and
joadson
ar
``
abolitionist
''
:
symbol
but
not
human
.

van
buren
is
a
weak
politician
but
noth
els
.

the
rest
of
the
``
slave
''
bare
exist
other
than
dress
for
the
set
.

like
mani
other
film
about
peopl
of
color
,
almost
all
the
major
player
ar
white
.

the
film
's
salvat
li
in
the
act
strength
of
everyon
involv
and
the
power
presenc
of
hounsou
.

the
former
model
's
first
major
role
is
a
winner
.

without
speak
more
than
five
word
of
english
,
he
convei
more
emot
than
most
actor
with
a
thousand
line
of
dialog
.

the
other
stand-out
is
hopkin
who
seem
to
be
make
a
career
out
of
portrai
american
presid
-lrb-
he
also
plai
the
titl
role
in
``
nixon
''
-rrb-
.

the
impass
speech
by
the
dodder
old
man
who
phase
in
and
out
of
ration
is
among
the
best
court-room
drama
ever
on
the
screen
.

there
ar
some
other
great
moment
.

especi
impress
ar
the
african
's
struggl
to
understand
what
is
go
on
in
the
strang
land
.

their
interpret
of
the
bibl
base
sole
on
the
pictur
and
their
own
experi
is
poignant
.

as
grand
as
the
epic
is
,
it
would
have
more
impact
had
it
focus
more
on
the
experi
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
african
.
