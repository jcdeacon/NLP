note

there

the

climax
;
the
elect
,
of

-rrb-
we
see
matthew
broderick
,
a
man
torn
to
a
primal
state
;
he
's
been
unfaith
to

by

and

equat
the
caus
of
hi
pain
,
hi
torment
,
with

no

how

student
have
come
and
gone
,
and
disappoint
him
as
an
educ
,
she
's
the
real

the
fact
that

further
illustr
that
freudian
foundat
of
entitl
which
all
men
,
no

have
in
their
relationship
;
a
tradit
expect
of
success
,
to
usurp
and
surpass
women
as
a
proverbi
industri
.

she
ca
n't
go
higher
than
him
.

he
wo
n't
allow
it
.

and
what
's
amaz
about
``
elect
''
is
that
everi
word
of
that
critic
is
drawn
from
a
rather
opaqu
metaphor
.

earli
in
the
film
we
learn
that
traci
wa
romant
,
and
then
sexual
,
involv
with
a
now
depart
teacher
.

it
's
like
payn
and
taylor
,
hi
co-screenwrit
,
have
taken
traci
,
a
girl
desper
for
friendship
,
loyalti
,
and
almost
pervers
drawn
the
mytholog
pattern
of
kid
who
were
so
utterli
reject
by
their
peer
,
that
thei
found
sit
at
the
teacher
'
lunch
tabl
more
fit
,
to
an
unlik
extrem
with
her
as
the
protagonist
.

and
it
's
amaz
the
compass
that
we
have
;
it
seem
so
real
to
us
,
and
not
mere
becaus
it
's
happen
befor
,
splash
all
over
the
front
page
,
but
,
becaus
of
the
all
around
``
nice
''
persona
of
these
peopl
,
we
easili
dismiss
the
truli
wayward
deed
of
the
charact
.

it
's
with
mandi
barnett

``
if
you
'll

''
plai
winsom
over
the
close
credit
that

of

most
;
a
final

viscou

ironi

sexual
,
though
,
is
not
the
onli
basi
for
payn
's
satir
,
or
it
success
.

it
also
make
a
tell
point
about
polit
,
friendship
,
and
class
boundari
.

satir
is
requir
-lrb-
or
ought
to
be
,
anywai
-rrb-
to
take
itself
serious
,
or
act
so
,
while
the
audienc
doe
not
.

it
's
a
fine
line
to

but
some

ignor
it
altogeth
-lrb-
``
drop

-rrb-
.

payn
and
taylor
hit
the
right
chord
;
their
charact
ar
real
peopl
:
neither
is
perfect
,
but
rather
both
of
the
lead
ar
flaw
,
misguid
individu
who
retain
,
somewhat
,
nobl
intent
at
heart
.

we
sympath
with
them
,
but
still
,
as
a
satir
,
their
idiosyncrat
behavior
,
and
their
wrongdo
,
is
taken
to
an
extrem
for
the
audienc
to
knowingli
chuckl
,
but
also
reflect
and
medit

about
.

minu
half

for
