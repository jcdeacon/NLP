whose
past
action
ar
come
back
to
haunt

were
instruct
not

minut

led
by
delroi
lindo
-lrb-
broken
arrow
-rrb-
ar
in
tom
's
hous
and

the
plot
sound
averag
,
just
like
most
other
kidnap
movi
that
you
've
alreadi
seen
,
and
it
wa
noth
more
than

but
thi

as
close
as

.

instead
,
i
am
offer
thi
monei
as
a
reward
on
your
head
,
dead

''

at
thi
point
,
the
plot
thicken
,
and
the
unusu
slow
start
of
the
film
turn
into
a
suspens-fill
action
film
with
great
stunt
.

the
last
half
of
the
film
is
veri
well
done
.

anoth
thing
that
carri
thi
film
ar
the
superb
perform
by
gibson
and
sinis
,
as
thei
collid
in
a
game
of

for

on
the
subject
:
``
it
make
you
wonder

''
first
in
of
mice
&
men
,
then
in
forrest
gump
,
and
most
recent
,
in
apollo
13
.

but
he
wa
surprisingli
devilish
and
cold
in
hi
portray
of
a
cop-gone-bad
.

gibson
,
of
cours
,
wa
just
be
gibson
,
in
an
oscar-worthi
perform
.

although
most
of
the
scene
were

a
veri
entertain
and
suspens
film
.
