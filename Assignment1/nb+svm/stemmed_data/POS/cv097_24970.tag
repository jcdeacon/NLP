english
professor

tripp
-lrb-
michael
dougla
-rrb-
is
a
master
.

seven
year
ago
,
hi
first
book
wa
a
hit
.

he
's
been
work
on
hi
second
--
a
short
200-page
piec
--
sinc
then
.

fear
that
he
ca
n't
live
up
to
the
first
,
he
ca
n't
bring
himself
to
finish
it
.

no
writer
's
block
,
he
's
near
3,000
page
with
no
end
in
sight
.

now
he
's
have
a
particularli
difficult
dai
.

the
colleg
's
annual
writer
confer
is
bring
in
accomplish
novelist
remind
tripp
that
other
peopl
ar
finish
_
their
_
book
.

dure
the
first
dai
,
hi
wife
ha
left
him
,
hi
marri
girlfriend
inform
him
she
's
pregnant
and
hi
agent
is
in
town
with
a
six-foot
transvestit
in
tow
.

by
the
even
,
our
besieg
writer
is
drive
though
the
snow-cover
street
of
pittsburgh
with
a
suicid
student
besid
him
,
a
stolen
jacket
that
marilyn
monro
wore
on
her
wed
dai
in
the
back
seat
and
a
murder
blind
dog
stuf
in
the
trunk
.

thi
could
be
a
pivot
point
in
hi
mid-life
crisi
.

there
's
a
lot
to
like
about
thi
movi
.

there
ar
no
huge
explos
,
shatter
glass
or
comput-gener
dinosaur
to
distract
from
the
veri
real
human
issu
.

gradi
is
caught
up
in
the
curs
of
peopl
who
accomplish
great
thing
earli
in
their
career
.

in
the
world
of
``
what
have
you
done
for
me
late
?
''

,
he
know
hi
second
book
ha
to
be
better
than
hi
first
.

instead
of
find
out
,
he
drift
,
comfort
in
the
insular
cocoon
of
academ
peter
panhood
.

he
doe
n't
have
much
of
a
life
and
neither
doe

jame

suicid
and
psychot

certainli
everyth
that
come
out
of
hi
mouth
is
a
lie
.

he
make
up
a
past
of
work
clash
anguish
becaus
the
truth
of
wealth
and
comfort
just
is
n't
interest
enough
.

as
the
weekend
progress
,
thei
ar
both
forc
to

.

that
's
the
question
thei
must
face
:
comfort
or
real
experi

franc
mcdormand
doe
a
good
job
of
her
limit
role
of
sara
,
gradi
's
marri
lover
but
we
never
understand
much
of
who
she
is
.

the
chemistri
between
the
two
of
them
is
non-exist
which
make
some
of
the
end
unconvinc
.

kati
holm
is
a
student
with
a
major
crush
on
the
professor
,
but
her
charact
goe
nowher
.

we
never
even
see
gradi
's
exit
wife
.

thi
is
veri
much
a
gui

.

the
vari
relationship
between
the
men
ar
much
more
convinc
than
ani
of
the
other
.

gradi
's
altern
mentor
and
reject
of
jame
is
the
centerpoint
of
the
film
,
not
him
and
sara
.

as
the
boomer
ag
,
expect
to
see
more
mid-life
crisi
film
to
catch
the
attent
of
that
demograph
.

eventu
it
'll
probabl
becom
clich
,
but
right
now
we
've
got
a
winner
.

i
'll
finish
thi
in
a
second

right
now
i
have
to
grab
