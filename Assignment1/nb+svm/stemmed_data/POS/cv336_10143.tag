scream
2
is
n't
quit
as
clever
as
it
predecessor
,
but
it
fill
the
gap
with
a
cut
wit
.

death
--
even
gruesom
,
bloodi
death
--
can
be
funni
if
handl
the
right
wai
-lrb-
some
will
be
offend
by
thi
statement
,
but
you
need
look
no
further
than
pulp
fiction
for
an
exampl
-rrb-
.

and
,
while
there
's
plenti
of
horror
to
go
around
in
scream
2
,
the
latest
'
90s
slasher
flick
incarn
,
there
ar
also
a
few
laugh
to
be
had
.

scream
2
is
a
slice-and-dice
movi
for
those
who
do
n't
take
their
horror
too
serious
.

the
success
of
the
origin
scream
took
everyon
in
the
industri
by
surpris
.

the
unexpect
blockbust
,
whose
gross
soar
over
the
$
100
million
mark
dure
it
six
month
releas
window
,
open
just
about
a
year
ago
and
turn
into
on
of
the
most
profit
horror
film
of
all
time
.

a
sequel
wa
inevit

fortun
,
nearli
the
entir
creativ
team

for
scream

,
and
actor
neve
campbel

courtnei
cox
,
david

jami

and
liev

as
stipul
by
on
of
the
``
rule
of
sequel
''
utter
by
a
movi-obsess
charact
in
the
film
,
the
bodi
count
in
scream
2
is
higher
than
that
in
the
origin
.

paradox
,
there
's
a
lot
less
gore
.

there
is
blood
,
of
cours
,
but
noth
excess
by
slasher-movi
standard
,
and
there
ar
no
depict
of
spill
entrail
.

craven
ha
rememb
that
scare
ar
more
import
that
graphic
displai
of
human
insid
and
bodili
fluid
.

a
second
strength
of
scream
2
is
that
it
featur
a
galleri
of
legitim
charact
rather
than
a
group
of
cardboard
cut-out
stereotyp
line
up
for
slaughter
.

after
all
,
we
've
known
some
of
these
peopl
for

--
it
's
almost
imposs
not
to
care
about
them

least
a
littl
