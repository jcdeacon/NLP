krippendorf
's
tribe
is
a
formula
comedi
.

done
poorli
,
formula
comedi
might
seem
to
signifi
the
downfal
of
american
cinema
.

howev
,
everi
now
and
then
,
on
emerg
,
like
krippendorf
's
tribe
,
that
actual
work
.

professor
jame
krippendorf
-lrb-
richard
dreyfuss
-rrb-
,
the
renown
anthropologist
,
is
in
troubl
.

hi
univers
gave
him
a
hefti
grant
to
discov
a
lost
tribe
in
new
guinea
.

howev
,
he
found
...
noth
.

hi
wife
ha
recent
di
,
and
he
ha
spent
the
remaind
of
the
grant
monei
in
rais
hi
three
kid
:
shelli
-lrb-
natasha
lyonn
-rrb-
,
mickei
-lrb-
gregori
smith
-rrb-
and
edmund
-lrb-
carl
michael
lidner
-rrb-
.

tonight
,
he
is
expect
to
lectur
on
hi
newfound
tribe
.

rather
than
break
the
new
-lrb-
and
face
the
consequ
of
misus
hi
fund
-rrb-
,
he
invent
a
tribe
:
the
shelmikedmu
-lrb-
name
after
hi
kid
-rrb-
.

howev
,
on
lie
beget
anoth
as
he
is
not
onli
requir
to
deliv
film
proof
of
the
shelmikedmu
,
but
hi
research
becom
a
popular
phenomenon
.

soon
,
professor
krippendorf
is
caught
up
in
an
elabor
ruse
in
which
he
film
mockumentari
footag
star
hi
children
as
the
shelmikedmu
tribal
member
.

hi
effort
ar
hamper
by
the
boast
of
an
over-eager
colleagu
,
veronica
micelli
-lrb-
jenna
elfman
-rrb-
,
and
the
intens
scrutini
of
a
rival
anthropologist
,
ruth
allen
-lrb-
lili
tomlin
-rrb-
.

krippendorf
's
tribe
doe
seem
to
requir
a
littl
suspens
of
disbelief
.

no
on
seem
to
question
the
wai
hi
field
documentari
seem
to
be
shot
with
multipl
camera
,
or
that
hi
newli
discov
tribesmen
have
startlingli
blue
ey
.

luckili
,
as
the
film
build
momentum
,
that
suspens
of
disbelief
is
easi
to
come
by
.

though
there
's
some
mild
humor
in
the
krippendorf
famili
try
to
pass
themselv
off
as
a
lost
tribe
,
the
real
humor
of
the
film
is
in
how
jame
get
trap
in
hi
ever
increas
snowbal
of
li
.

the
doubl
mean
to
mani
of
the
shelmikedmu
appear
ar
enjoy
,
and
the
comic
time
requir
for
some
of
the
film
's
latter
scene
is
superb
.

richard
dreyfuss
is
terrif
as
the
hapless
professor
who
soon
lose
control
of
hi
own
imaginari
tribe
.

jenna
elfman
's
posit
as
a
romant
lead
seem
a
bit
forc
at
time
,
but
she
plai
the
part
with
extrem
affabl
.

even
the
kid
,
who
in
film
like
thi
tend
to
be
a
bit
on
the
precoci
side
,
ar
endear
and
humor
.

ye
,
the
film
doe
veer
occasion
into
some
rather
lowbrow
humor
,
but
it
ha
the
best
excus
of
all
:
it
's
funni
.

it
mai
not
go
down
as
an
all-time
classic
,
but
it
certainli
deliv
what
you
expect
from
a
comedi
:
plenti
of
laugh
.
