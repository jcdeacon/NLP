who
ar

when

when

she
meet

a

worn-out

and
unhappi
woman
,
who
live
with
her
drug-addict
german
girlfriend
,
greta
-lrb-
patricia
clarkson
-rrb-
,
a
pathet
former
actress
who
is
usual
so
out-of-it
that
she
often
is
in
and
out
of
concious
.

syd
quickli
strike
up
a
convers
with
luci
,
and
discov
that
she
us
to
be
an
acclaim
photograph
ten
year
befor
.

luci
claim
she
doe
n't
want
to
get
back
into
the
profess
,
but
syd
manag
to
convinc
the
``
frame

editor
to
do
a
piec
on
her
work
.

all
the
while
,
syd
begin
to
grow
deep
feel
for

,
even
though
she
ha
never
previous
been
attract
to
a
woman
,
and
luci
start
a
battl
with
her
person
demon
.

``
high
art
,
''
is
such
an
effect
motion
pictur
becaus
it
is
never
suger-coat
or
ideal
,
but
instead
an
honest
and
convinc
portrait
of
a
hand
of
unhappi
peopl
whose
live
ar
go
nowher
,
while
syd
's
luck
begin
to
rise
.

the
film
in
no
wai
is
about
lesbian
,
but
about
love
,
which
wa
a
refresh
chang
of
pace
from
the
usual
stereotyp
portrait
of
homosexu
.

as
luci
and
syd
grow
closer
and
closer
togeth
,
we
realli
do
believ
that
thei
ar
fall
in
love
with
each
other
,
even
if
the
relationship
might
be
doom
.

with
thi
pictur
,
alli
sheedi
's
star
ha
risen
onc
again
,
thank
to
her
touch
,
nearli
flawless
portrtay
of
luci
,
a
woman
who
,
in
the
cours
of
a
decad
,
ha
found
her
life
consum
almost
entir
by
drug
,
which
ha
taken
awai
her
onc-blossom
career
.

her
charact
realli
is
tragic
,
and
on
particular
scene
involv
luci
and
her
mother
,
in
which
luci
admit
to
her
that
she
ha
a
drug
problem
,
and
her
mother
matter-of-factli
respond
by
sai
she
ca
n't
help
her
,
is
heartbreak
.

although
not
autobiograph
,
sheedi
ha
had
drug
problem
in
her
past
,
and
i
suspect
she
brought
that
knowledg
of
alreadi
be
in
luci
's
footstep
to
her
role
.

also
veri
good
is
radha
mitchel
as
syd
,
who
previous
star
in
the
slight
1997
australian
comedi
,
``
love
and
other
catastroph

caught
me
by
surpris
with
her
perform
.

easili
be
abl
to
pass

christina
ricci
's
older
sister
,
mitchel
obtain
the
same
natur
charisma
that
ha
made
ricci
so
popular
recent
.

as
accur
as
almost
everi
detail
is
in
,
``
high
art
,
''
i
wish
the
relationship
had
been
more
tightli
written
involv
syd
and
jame
,
who
,
plai
by
gabriel
mann
,
is
left
with
a
throwawai
role
.

by
the
time
he
find
out
about
syd
and
luci
,
he
disappear
from
the
film
,
and
i
wish
there
had
been
anoth
scene
where
thei
confront
each
other
.

thi
is
a
veri
minor
fault
,
howev
,
in
a
film
that
is
full
of
rich
.

although
mani
of
the
charact
ar
stuck
in
a
hopeless
pit
of
despair
,
