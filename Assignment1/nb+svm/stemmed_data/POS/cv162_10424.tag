and
it
's
onli
at
about
the
film
's
midwai
point
when
it
becom

like
it

,
scream

open
with
a
splashi
,
ey-grab
prologu
which
onli

thi

howev
,
although
it
tri
hard
and
ha
some
good
idea
--
the
nightmarishli
enthusiast
audienc
in
the
film
vagu
remind
me
of
the
on
i
wa
share
the
theatr
with

and
i
wa
certainli
think
about
gut
the
overli-noisi
person
a
few
seat
awai
myself
after
about
fifteen
minut
--
the
prologu
is
a
pale
imit
of
the
bravura
open
sequenc
in
the
origin
with
drew
barrymor
-lrb-
where
her
perform
not
onli
convinc
me
that
she
*
could
*
act
,
but
wa
so
good
that
it
would
rank
among
the
best
perform
in
a
horror
film
that
i
've
ever
seen
-rrb-
.

there
ar
too
mani

,
hip
pop-cultur
refer
cram
into
the
scream

sequenc
,
and
the
setup
is
n't
nearli
as
cleverli
frighten
as
scream
's
;
while
the
first
film
's
prefac
dizzyingli
built
up
to
a
final
shot
that
wa
exhilaratingli
terrifi
,
the
payoff
here
is
almost
campili
theatric
.

flash
to
the
campu
of
a

,
where

hi

here
is

the

incident
provid
surprisingli
littl
backstori
,
although
i
suppos
a
good

can
be
made
that
it
realli
is
n't
necessari
--
not
becaus
so
mani
peopl
have
seen
the
first
instal
,
but
becaus
thi
is
,
after
all
,
a
sequel
to
a
slasher
film
:
what
do
you
*
think
*
happen
to
these
charact
in
the
prior
movi
?

there
's
a
lot
of
new
face
on
the
scene
too
:
sidnei
's
new
boyfriend
,
derek
-lrb-
jerri
o'connel
-rrb-
and
her
new
roommat
halli

and
a
pair
of
simper

-lrb-
rebecca
gayheart
and
siren

-rrb-
.

ani
of
these
charact
could
be
the
killer
--
or
for
that
matter
,
could
be
the
next
victim
.

as
is
seemingli
becom
a
regular
stapl
of
a
kevin
williamson
screenplai
,
the
narr
is
onc
again
frame
around
the
increasingli-flimsi
premis
of
a
whodunit
.

on
problem
that
scream
did
n't
have
wa
keep
you
interest
in
the
ident
of
the
killer
.

here
-lrb-
and
to
some
extent
in
i
know
what
you
did
last
summer
-rrb-
,
mr.
williamson
's
screenplai
seem
slightli
hamper
by
try
to
turn
the
ident
of
the
killer
into
a
mysteri
.

the
film
occasion
becom
so
bog
down
with
misdirect
that
you
can
sens
it
strain
at
the
seam
to
try
and
drop
red
her
left
and
right
at
the
expens
of
it
thriller
element
.

-lrb-
it
doe
n't
help
matter
ani
that
the
killer
's
alter-ego
is
fairli
obviou
from
the
get-go
.
-rrb-

inde
,
the
final
plai
as
full-out
camp
when
the
villain
is
final
unmask
,
froth
at
the
mouth
with
glaze
ey
.

thi
is
on
of
those
case
where
the
villain
goe
on
such
an
endless
diatrib
about
their
machin
,
scheme
,
and
motiv
,
that
you
actual
get
bore
listen
and
just
want
them
all
to
get
on
with
it
.

while
the
basic
setup
and
premis
for
the
film
is
fairli
contriv
,
the
aspect
where
it
's
head-and-shoulder
abov
it
predecessor
is
in
it
suspens
sequenc
.

thei
're
stage
much
more
imagin
here
-lrb-
save
for
the
first
post-prologu
murder
,
which
is
handl
in
such
a
mediocr
,
convent
fashion
that
it
seem
to
be
cull
directli
from
the
predict
1980s
slasher
flick
that
the
first
film
satir
-rrb-
,
and
ar
much
more
fun
to
watch
.

it
's
hard
to
hold
back
a
smile
dure
a
giddi
scene
where
sidnei
and
her
companion
have
to
climb
over
the
incapacit
killer
in
order
to
escap
from
a
car
wreck
,
and
a
cat-and-mous
chase
involv
gale
and
dewei
in
a
campu
sound
lab
is
veri
nice
stage
,
although
it
ultim
resolut
is
hilari
overblown
.

in
term
of
it
charact
,
the
strong
part
of
the
film
is
the
interest
relationship
between
gale
and
dewei
-lrb-
who
ambl
onto
the
screen
accompani
by
hi
veri
own
theme
music
-rrb-
.

their
verbal
spar
at
the
outset
provid
much
humour
--
an
exchang
where
dewei
defens
rebuk
charg
of
a
perceiv
aura
of
incompet
is
well-written
--
and
there
's
a
curious
endear
aspect
about
their
relationship
amidst
all
the
mayhem
and
bloodsh
.

on
the
other
hand
,
sidnei
is
pretti
dull
here
.

she
doe
n't
have
ani
compel
presenc
,
and
there
's
noth
particularli
interest
about
her
thi
time
around
to
make
us
care
about
her
other
than
that
she
's
the
return
heroin
.

given
thi
,
and
the
fact
that
there
's
no
strong
second
banana
charact
for
sidnei
-lrb-
elis
neal
's
role
is
n't
nearli
substant
enough
to
adequ
fill
rose
mcgowan
's
shoe
-rrb-
,
it
's
no
wonder
why
the
role
for
gale
and
dewei
have
been
significantli
augment
for
thi
instal
of
the
film
.

what
surpris
me
the
most
about
scream
2
is
it
zealous
in
decim
it
cast
.

the
film
's
mount
bodi
count
bear
out
the
fact
that
*
no
*
charact
is
safe
-lrb-
well
,
*
almost
*
-rrb-
;
while
in
princip
i
applaud
thi
bold
polici
,
at
some
point
you
've
got
to
be
wonder
about
just
how
mani
charact
will
make
it
to
the
next
sequel
.

-lrb-
i
wa
particularli
surpris
with
the
untim
demis
of
on
in
particular
,
whose
cast
for
the
next
instal
of
the
seri
would
've
seem
obviou
.
-rrb-

but
hei
,
as
rose
mcgowan
's
charact
said
in
the
first
film
:
``
no
,
pleas
do
n't
kill
me
,
mr.
ghostfac
--
i
want
to
be
in
the
sequel
!
''

look
what
that
got
her
.
