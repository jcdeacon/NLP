the
ultim
match
up
between
good
and
evil
,
``
the
untouch
''
is
an
excel
movi
becaus
it
look
deeper
into
an
alreadi
examin
rivalri
.

base
on
the
1959
televis
show
of
the
same
titl
,
``
the
untouch
''
mai
be
an
exagger
of
the
real
life
event
that
took
place
,
but
it
fit
togeth
perfectli
with
some
beautifulli
film
action
sequenc
,
some
excel
act
,
a
memor
score
,
and
a
clever
script
.

the
film
take
place
in
chicago
dure
the
prohibit
era
where
mobster
led
by
the
ruthless
al
capon
run
an
underground
market
of
liquor
to
the
demand
public
.

elliot
ness
and
a
small
forc
of
men
known
as
the
untouch
attempt
the
imposs
by
try
to
stop
capon
and
try
to
maintain
peac
and
order
.

howev
,
as
ness
soon
learn
,
in
order
to
stabil
peac
,
you
have
to
bend
a
few
law
.

the
fact
that
capon
is
evil
is
veri
appar
from
the
first
few
scene
.

the
film
begin
with
capon
,
plai
perfectli
by
deniro
,
declar
that
he
is
not
a
violent
man
and
he
is
a
firm
believ
in
follow
all
law
.

the
film
then
quickli
transfer
to
the
next
scene
in
which
on
of
capon
's
men
bomb
a
restaur
that
contain
mani
innoc
peopl
includ
a
littl
girl
.

from
thi
point
we
know
capon
is
evil
,
not
onli
becaus
he
kill
without
hesit
,
but
also
becaus
he
is
a
ly
bastard
.

right
from
the
first
five
minut
of
the
film
,
de
palma
ha
creat
a
hatr
toward
capon
and
he
show
that
thi
man
must
be
brought
down
at
all
cost
.

thi
develop
hatr
is
befor
the
film
's
hero
,
ness
,
is
even
introduc
.

i
found
thi
approach
to
be
veri
clever
becaus
in
a
small
durat
of
time
there
is
a
great
amount
of
admir
for
ness
and
an
equal
amount
of
hatr
for
capon
.

the
film
onli
get
better
from
thi
point
.

with
the
format
of
the
untouch
,
there
is
a
group
of
men
wear
long
,
dark
overcoat
and
hat
.

thei
walk
in
unison
and
thei
onli
look
forward
.

as
thei
walk
down
the
street
thei
ar
observ
and
fear
by
citizen
.

hold
shot
gun
and
pistol
in
their
hand
to
stop
crimin
,
thi
imag
of
vigilant
must
have
influenc
futur
film
.

on
that
come
to
mind
is
``
the
matrix
''
when
neo
,
morpheu
,
triniti
,
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
first
come
into
the
virtual
world
.

wear
more
futurist
outfit
of
the
same
1930
's
style
,
the
similar
between
these
two
ar
countless
.

``
the
untouch
''
ha
some
of
the
hippest
,
bravest
hero
in
ani
action
film
.

the
four
member
were
the
onli
on
will
to
go

.

each

that
separ
them
