suspens

ensu

the
problem
of

the

,
as
thei
frantic
attempt
to
come
up
with
idea
on
how
to
save
the
astronaut
from

.

also
,
there
ar
quit
a
number

footag
which
were
broadcast
dure
the

which
took

the
special
effect
by

ar
up
to
standard
and
the
music
suit

drama
veri
well
,
thank
to

.

watch
out
for
the
launch
sequenc
,
it
is
simpli
on
of
the
most
breathtak
scene
of
the
film
.

a
bad
point
though
:
apollo
13
featur
much
technic
jargon
and
mani
physic
concept
in
it
script
.

those
who
consid
themselv
`
scientif
illiter
'
might
have
a
slight
problem
understand
what
caus
thi
and
what
caus
that
dure
the
cours
of
the
show
.

thi
is
howev
,
just
a
minor
point
,
just
forget
all
those
technic
bullshit
and
immers
yourselv
into
the
drama
and
suspens
throughout
the
film
.

you
should
enjoi
it
.
