deconstruct
a
stori
as
well
as
atom
egoyan
.

i
'm
refer
,
specif
,
to
the
narr
form
.

in
the
sweet
hereaft
,
egoyan
tell
hi
stori
in
a
similar
framework
to
hi
exotica
or
the
adjust
.

said
stori
,
of
a
fatal
school
bu
accid
in
the
small
town
of
sam
dent
,
british
columbia
,
that
shatter
the
moral
of
the
local
,
is
told
in
a
most
unstraightforward
manner
.

when
the
film
open
,
the
accid
ha
alreadi
happen
,
and
stephen
-lrb-
the
wonder
holm
-rrb-
,
a
polit
ambul-chaser
,
ha
arriv
with
the
promis
of
a
lawsuit
that
will
eek
out
the
truth
of
what
realli
occur
that
fate
morn
.

throughout
,
we
get
to
meet
the
parent
of
the
dead
,
broken
soul
who
follow
stephen
like
``
the
pi
piper
''
-lrb-
passag
of
which
ar
read
dure
the
film
-rrb-
.

but
there
is
on
live
passeng
,
the
paralyz
nicol
-lrb-
pollei
-rrb-
,
whose
dark
secret
of
a
life
befor
the
accid
mai
affect
her
decis
to
testifi
.

we
final
do
see
the
accid
,
about
three
quarter
into
the
film
,
which
is
a
stun
visual
effect
.

a
horrif
long
take
that
show
the
bu
slide
,
then
stop
,
then
collaps
into
a
frozen
lake
,
is
the
best
digit
trickeri
in
ani
movi
thi
year
and
,
perhap
,
ever
,
in
a
motion
pictur
.

the
fractur
narr
also
intercut
a
preoccupi
stephen
on
an
airplan
,
travel
to
meet
hi
hiv-posit
runawai
daughter
,
as
well
as
glimps
of
the
artifici
happi
live
these
peopl
led
pre-accid
.

i
have
a
problem
not
with
the
stori
or
stori
structur
,
but
with
egoyan
's
heavi-handed
behind
the
camera
.

for
the
first
hour
or
so
,
i
can
quit
honestli
sai
i
wa
on
the
verg
of
tear
;
these
ar
miser
,
miser
peopl
.

but
that
's
just
the
problem
:
so
anguish
ar
these
folk
that
sympathi
wane
after
a
while
,
when
a
lot
of
sad
becom
too
much
.

also
,
a
subplot
involv
incest
ring
untru
.

perhap
it
would
n't
feel
so
contriv
if
it
were
n't
shot
in
such
a
tast
manner
.

there
ar
two
charact
who
ar
father
and
daughter
;
when
thei
first
appear
i
thought
thei
were
lover
.

i
wa
half-right
.

nevertheless
it
's
worth-see
.

the
delight
critic
geoff
pever
recent
wrote
that
``
american
film
ar
about
action
,
canadian
film
ar
about
consequ
,
''
henc
a
recent
wave
of
film
about
the
effect
of
shock
and
death
from
toronto
director
,
includ
crash
and
kiss
.

the
sweet
hereaft
is
much
better
than
either
of
these
two
film
,
simpli
becaus
it
's
not
bore
or
,
in
the
case
of
kiss
,
afraid
of
it
own
materi
-lrb-
necrophilia
-rrb-
.

egoyan
is
a
fine
,
fine
,
postmodern
storytel
,
whose
work
is
entertain
,
edgi
and
smart
,
if
a
bit
too
intellectu
at
time
.

though
i
harp
on
the
weighti
of
the
materi
,
i
wa
alwai
absorb
,
engross
,
and
surpris
by
the
sweet
hereaft
.
