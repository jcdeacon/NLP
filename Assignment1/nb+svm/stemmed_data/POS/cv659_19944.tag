the
first
hour
is
veri
slow
,
the

out
to
be
a
veri
power
and
move
film
.

i
wa
expect
thi
film
to
be
mercuri
rise
2
,
but
wa
astonish
to
discov
an
extrem
well
plot
out
littl
thriller
with
an
outstandingli
satisfi
end
.

you
'll
find
yourself
mental
retrac
your
step
through
the
film
to
see
if
you
actual
saw
what
you
think
you
did
onc
the
credit
roll
.

i
must
give
m.
night
shyamalan
a
lot
of
credit
for
a
brilliantli
written
screenplai
.

the
cast
should
also
be
given
a
lot
of
credit
for
make
the
movi
as
solid
as
it
is
.

a
lesser
cast
could
have
made
thi
film
a
joke
.

bruce
willi
portrai
hi
charact
perfectli
,
balanc
hi
need
to
help
cole
and
hi
agoni
over
hi
strain
relationship
with
hi
wife
skillfulli
.

halei
joel
osment
shine
as
nine
year
old
cole
,
show
patienc
in
hi
charact
that
few
young
actor
these
dai
can
pull
off
.

toni
collett
,
look
markedli
differ
from
her
pathet
charact
in
muriel
's
wed
,
give
a
strong
perform
as
cole
's
mother
,
who
is
try
to
cope
with
both
her
son
's
``
ill
''
and
the
pass
of
her
mother
.

final
,
olivia
william
deftli
portrai
a
woman
have
to
struggl
with
a
husband
who
's
not
around
and
flirtat
with
a
co-worker
that
could
lead
to
a
begrudgingli
accept
end
.

it
's
a
shame
that
thei
show
cole
's
abil
in
the
trailer
,
becaus
the
movi
take
close
to
forti
minut
to
get
around
to
do
the
same
,
so
we
alreadi
know
what
's
go
on
befor
most
of
the
rest
of
the
cast
doe
.

in
retrospect
though
,
the
forti
minut
set-up
is
essenti
to
enjoi
the
end
of
the
film
,
so
i
have
fewer
complaint
now
then
i
did
while
i
wa
watch
the
film
.

i
'm
glad
that
the
run
of
teen-style
horror
film
ha
pass
and
filmmak
ar
start
to
make
more
adult
fare
.

film
like
thi
,
the
similarli
theme
stir
of
echo
,
and
countless
other
to
be
releas
later
in
the
year
should
make
for
a
pretti
entertain
close
to
1999
.
