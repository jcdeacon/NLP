on

not

the
same
can
be
said
of
the
charact
of

it

respond
to
gilbert
's
descript
of
hi
father
with
,
``
i
knew

.
''

gilbert
is
a
man
harbor
an
ever-grow
bitter
about
where
he
find
himself
in
life
,
a
bitter
which
reveal
itself
in
moment
of
surpris

in
on
scene
,
he
allow
local
children
to
look
at
hi
mother
through
their
window
,
displai
her
like
a

hi

seem
to
be
mock
by
arni
's
repeat
chant
of
,
``
we
're
not

''
but
instead
of
express
hi
dissatisfact
he
let
hi
anger
simmer
,
and
it
becom
clear
that
he
is
follow
in
hi
father
's
footstep
in
thi
regard
.

johnni

expertli
demonstr
the
tension
central
to
gilbert
by

but
he
never
give
in
to

blank
or
simpli
regurgit
hi
naif
role
in
benni

he
put

such
big
name

as
john
malkovich

whose

never

dicaprio
is
perfect
to
the
last
twitch
and
squeal
,
and
anyon
who
ha
ever
spent

with

kid
will
be
hard-press
