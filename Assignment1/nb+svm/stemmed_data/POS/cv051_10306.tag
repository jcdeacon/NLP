a

in
a

adapt

in

case
,
franci

coppola
's
take
on
the

while
rudi

-lrb-
and
the

main
concern
is
thi
case

in

brief
role

written
for
the
screen
and
direct
by
coppola
,
the
rainmak
is
the
best
grisham
film
yet
mostli
becaus
it
doe
not
take
itself
too
serious
.

coppola
's
most
notabl
--
and
effect
--
contribut
to
the
tri-and-true
grisham
formula
is
a
sens
of
humor
about
itself
,
which
larg
come
in
the
presenc
of
danni
devito
-lrb-
as
rudi
's
unlicens
co-counsel
-rrb-
and
golden
globe
nomine

voight
-lrb-
as
the
insur
compani
's
hotshot
attornei
-rrb-
.

the
inclus
of
the
batter
wife
subplot
feel
rather
superflu
,
but
dane
is
as
superb
as
alwai
.

then
,
of
cours
,
there
is
damon
,
who
nice
juggl
the
weighti
-lrb-
the
insur
case
,
the
spousal
abus
-rrb-
and
the
humor
-lrb-
rudi
's
often
comic
naivet
-rrb-
requir
of
hi
role
without
miss
a
beat
.

as
good
as
he
is
in
the
rainmak
,
damon
showcas
the
depth
of
hi
talent
in
good
will
hunt
,
direct
by
gu
van
sant
and
written
by
actor
ben
affleck
and
damon
himself
.

damon
plai
the
titl
charact
,
will
hunt
,
a
troubl
young
construct
worker/janitor
at
mit
who
also
happen
to
be
a
supergeniu
.

in
an
attempt
to
steer
thi
brilliant
young
mind
in
the
right
direct
,
an
mit
math
professor
-lrb-
stellan

commun

sean

-lrb-
robin
william

,
to
counsel
the
abras
,
standoffish
will
and
try
to
help
him
come
to
term
with
hi
turbul
life
.

good
will
hunt
is
the
touchi-feeli
enterpris
it
plot
synopsi
suggest
,
but
to
simpli
dismiss
it
as
that
would
be
to
discount
the
true
emot
chord
affleck
and
damon
's
intellig
script
touch
.

even
though
no
on
-lrb-
and
,
if
so
,
_
veri
_
few
peopl
-rrb-
can
directli
relat
to
will
's
burden
of
superhuman
intellig
,
the
insecur
he
suffer

univers
.

the
materi
is
brought
to
life
by
the
terrif
ensembl
of
actor
.

william
deliv
a
nice
dramat
turn
;
affleck
,
a
hot
up-and-come
actor
himself
-lrb-
chase
ami
-rrb-
,
turn
up
in
a
warm
and
charm
perform
as
will
's
best
friend
;
and
the
ever-appeal
minni
driver
shine
as
will
's
harvard-school
love
interest
.

the
clear
standout
in
the
cast
,
though
,
is
damon
,
who
brave
doe
not
soften
will
's
prickli
natur
but
ha
such
a
natur
eas
with
the
audienc
that
it
is
hard
_
not
_
to
care
for
him
.

so
mani
name
come
and
go
with
the
fluctuat
of
the
hollywood
hype
machin
,
but
base
on
hi
impress
work
in
john
grisham
's
the
rainmak
and
especi
good
will
hunt
,
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
matt
damon
is
on
name
we
will
be
hear
a
lot
more
of
in
the
year
to
