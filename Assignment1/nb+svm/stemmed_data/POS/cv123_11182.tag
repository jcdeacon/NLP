prefer
hi
earli
work
with
lyricist
tim
rice
,
present
a
music
which
is
total
unlik
ani
music
befor
it
time
.

webber
and
rice
do
not
subscrib
to
the
gaiti
of
such
music
as
``
oklahoma
!

,
''
or
the
slapstick
of
show
like
``
a
funni
thing
happen
on
the
wai
to
the
forum
.
''

thei
instead
tackl
hot
issu
from
our
past
,
and
view
them
differ
,
and
pack
them
togeth
with
redund
,
catchi
music
,
as
well
as
thought
lyric
.

like
``
jesu
christ
superstar
,
''
which
examin
the
rise
and
fall
of
jesu
in
hi
last
dai
from
a
fame
perspect
-lrb-
in
the
cool
tune
``
superstar
,
''
a
dead
juda
come
back
from
the
dead
to
ask
jesu
why
he
did
n't
spread
hi
messag
wider
-rrb-
,
``
evita
''
take
an
invent
stanc
on
it
topic
,
thi
time
be
the
fame
wife
of
argentinian
dictat
,
juan
pern
,
eva
,
who
slept
her
wai
to
the
top
and
becam
famou
chiefli
becaus
she
got
attent
,
much
like
the
woman
plai
her
:
madonna
-lrb-
although
i
think
madonna
did
rise
to
the
top
for
her
music
talent
,
among
other
thing
-rrb-
.

``
evita
''
deal
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
eva
pern
,
a
woman
who
captur
the
heart
of
the
nation
after
marri
juan
-lrb-
jonathan
pryce
-rrb-
,
then
di
at
the
young
ag
of
33
,
creat
an
intern
stir
of
mourn
not
unlik
that
of
princess
di
-lrb-
the
two
do
share
a
bit
in
common
,
although
it
wa
n't
like
di
slept
to
``
the
top
''
-rrb-
.

webber
and
rice
sure
chose
bizarr
topic
for
their
music
,
but
thei
alwai
have
a
point
for
do
it
.

here
,
thei
wish
to
expos
her
for
what
she
is
,
but
still
show
that
despit
all
of
her
mani
drawback
,
her
ly
,
and
cover
up
for
her
fascist
husband
,
but
show
that
she
wa
still
a
good
woman
with
fairli
good
intent
,
and
her
death
wa
veri
sad
.

it
's
also
a
music
,
with
almost
no
word
not
unsung
.

the
film
plai
like
a
rock
opera
,
much
like
their
``
jesu
christ
superstar
,
''
with
mani
giant
music
sequenc
just
like
the
old
music
,
even
if
thei
do
possess
veri
intellig
lyric
,
which
creat
not
onli
an
intellectu
enlighten
experi
,
but
also
a
veri
entertain
on
.

after
all
,
thi
is
a
music
,
and
webber
's
music
never
undermin
thi
.

thei
ar
a
balanc
of
energi
and
intellectu
depth
,
walk
on
a
fine
line
between
the
both
,
and
never
stumbl
on
either
side
.

thi
is
why
the
begin
of
``
evita
''
is
kind
of
a
let-down
.

okai
,
it
is
a
let-down
.

i
'm
not
sai
the
open
moment
ar
bad
,
becaus
thei
're
pretti
good
.

but
what
come
after
is
a
lifeless
,
un-entertain
,
and
total
unreward
sequenc
where
she
con
a
singer
-lrb-
jimmi
nail
-rrb-
into
take
eva
to
bueno
air
after
a
on-night
stand
.

in
the
music
,
it
's
a
fun
,
energet
sequenc
,
culimin
in
the
show
stopper
,
``
bueno
air
,
''
which
is
also
lifeless
.

then
a
punch
is
pull
as
we
see
eva
be
screw
over
by
the
singer
,
instead
of
her
leav
him
,
where
she
end
up
sing
the
sad
tune
,
``
anoth
suitcas
in
anoth
hall
,
''
which
wa
meant
for
a
later
charact
,
screw
over
by
eva
.

the
portray
of
eva
in
the
begin
is
too
soft
,
seem
like
parker
and
oliv
stone
,
who
adapt
it
for
the
screen
,
ar
afraid
to
present
her
for
what
she
is
,
even
while
it
's
be
narrat
by
a
hater
of
eva
's
,
the
omnipot
-lrb-
antonio
bandera
-rrb-
,
who
present
her
in
a
neg
light
.

for
a
while
,
it
look
like
alan
parker
ca
n't
pull
it
off
.

howev
,
the
film
pull
itself
togeth
in
a
flash
,
and
after
that
song
is
over
,
and
the
giddili
nihilist
song
``
goodby
and
thank
you
,
''
where
we
see
eva
go
through
a
long
line
of
lover
who
help
her
ascend
,
is
magnific
,
darkli
comic
,
and
just
gleeful
.

from
thi
point
on
,
the
film
is
hypnot
,
satisfi
,
and
satir
.

no
more
punch
ar
thrown
,
and
the
basic
outlin
of
the
origin
music
ar
in
tact
.

we
see
eva
woo
and
marri
juan
,
get
him
out
of
jail
,
rise
to
stardom
,
falter
a
bit
,
come
back
,
and
then
gradual
die
of
cancer
-lrb-
i
think
it
wa
becaus
of
cancer
-rrb-
.

more
importantli
,
mani
of
the
theme
from
the
music
carri
on
with
thi
,
as
well
as
some
fill-in-the-gap
reconnassainc
work
.

juan
,
who
is
pretti
underwritten
in
the
music
,
is
given
some
extra
scene
,
and
expos
as
what
he
wa
for
eva
:
an
accessori
.

a
mute
scene
where
he
tri
to
visit
her
respect
room
but
is
shun
allow
us
to
learn
more
about
juan
,
and
understand
hi
sad
more
than
we
did
befor
.

>
from
the
``
goodby
and
thank
you
''
number
on
,
the
film
show
eva
try
to
cover
up
for
the
horribl
govern
by
do
cheap
and
petti
thing
which
woo
a
nation
,
and
save
a
govern
,
even
while
it
left
the
nation
's
peopl
downtrodden
.

but
despit
thi
,
the
nation
still
love
eva
,
and
when
she
slip
into
death
,
the
world
mourn
her
becaus
she
wa
a
star
.

that
's
when
our
narrat
,
ch
,
come
out
to
show
that
she
wa
n't
the
great
woman
she
realli
wa
,
and
expos
her
fame
.

describ
thi
charact
is
difficult
,
mainli
becaus
he
ha
no
real
realist
background
-lrb-
he
's
said
to
be
base
on
the
revolutionari
ch
guevera
,
but
the
two
probabl
could
have
never
met
,
like
thei
do
in
the
film
-rrb-
,
but
he
serv
as
a
perspect
on
eva
,
but
even
hi
perspect
ca
n't
help
us
from
feel
bad
when
eva
di
a
pathet
death
.

alan
parker
,
no
stranger
to
bizarr
music
-lrb-
he
's
done
``
fame
,
''
``
the
committ
,
''
``
bugsi
malon
,
''
and
``
pink
floyd
the
wall
''
-
the
latter
which
is
absolut
brilliant
-rrb-
,
nail
the
film
,
expos
everyth
for
what
it
is
.

we
cry
for
evita
at
the
end
becaus
we
feel
we
should
,
by
the
wai
it
is
present
.

hi
direct
is
manipul
for
a
reason
:
to
show
the
mourn
for
what
it
is
.

and
there
is
energi
throughout
,
with
lot
of
bright
color
,
and
scene
which
ar
cinemat
entertan
,
as
well
as
enrich
and
deep
,
such
as
the
balconi
scene
where
she
sing
``
do
n't
cry
for
me
,
argentina
,
''
and
her
death
sequenc
,
which
is
poignant
becuas
of
how
sad
it
is
.

madonna
's
golden
globe
win
perform
is
much
like
the
movi
:
start
kinda
downhil
then
goe
up
quickli
,
reman
there
for
the
rest
of
the
film
.

at
the
begin
,
she
look
like
she
's
too
busi
concentr
on
her
sing
to
act
,
but
she
eventu
get
it
right
,
though
never
realli
get
the
presenc
of
,
sai
,
patti
lupon
-lrb-
who
did
the
role
in
it
american
premier
back
in
the
late
70s
-rrb-
.

her
death
,
though
,
is
brilliant
.

her
sing
could
be
better
though
.

i
know
she
took
lesson
to
improv
her
rang
and
all
,
but
it
still
sound
like
she
's
try
to
hard
.

she
sound
wai
too
soft
in
sever
place
where
she
should
be
comand
-lrb-
like
...
patti
lupon-i
heard
her
sing
on
an
old
``
evita
''
cd
,
and
you
could
just
feel
her
stage
presenc
without
even
see
her
-rrb-
.

but
it
's
gener
veri
good
,
although
not
up
to
the
brillianc
the
role
realli
requir
.

antonio
bandera
,
who
is
almost
like
a
guilti
pleasur
these
dai
-lrb-
i
'm
on
of
the
few
peopl
who
think
he
rock
-rrb-
,
is
extrem
comand
in
hi
perform
,
present
a
lovabl
narrat
.

hi
sing
is
veri
good
,
though
noth
compar
to
the
origin
,
mandi
patinkin
.

he
doe
have
a
pretti
good
sing
voic
,
and
a
great
rang
.

and
jonathan
pryce
is
pretti
awesom
,
although
veri
brief
at
time
,
in
hi
role
as
juan
,
seem
to
put
on
a
poker
face
for
hi
melancholi
facad
.

although
it
get
off
to
a
rocki
start
-lrb-
``
rocki
''
's
polit
for
what
it
realli
is
-rrb-
,
it
soon
pick
up
and
becom
a
wonderulli
poignant
music
.

like
the
other
music
releas
in
'
96
-lrb-
woodi
allen
's
``
everyon
sai
i
love
you
''
-rrb-
,
it
's
a
remind
that
the
hollywood
music
mai
be
dead
,
but
it
can
come
back
everi
now
and
then
for
a
brief
perform
.
