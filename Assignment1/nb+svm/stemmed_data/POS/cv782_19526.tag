with
a
dose
of
social
critic

he
re-creat
the
frighten
atmospher
of
the

middl
of

i

veri
much
the
emot

brutal
contrast
between

while

and
then
the
ship
goe
down
and
the
few
survivor
ar
left
alon
under

and
the
chill
air
.

howev
,
the
actual
disast
is
happen
almost
at
the
end
of
the
movi
,
while
the
first
two
hour
ar
just
beauti
set

bad

in

somewher
insid
the
ship

lovett

crew
discov
a
sketchbook

here
,
in

shape
of
a
nude
young

,
is
a
window
into
the
distant

of
1912
.

lovett
is
extrem
surpris
when
he
get
's
a
phone
call
from
rose
dawson
,
claim
that
she
is
a
model
.

she
is
immedi
helicopt
onto
the
vessel
,
and
she
get
the
first
glimps
of
the
fate
ship
in
80
year
.

as

on

in

a

a

stori
slowli
emerg
and
the
two
lover
must
not
onli
experi
the
differ
between
the
social
class
,
but
also
face
the
greatest
power
on
earth-death
.

cameron
could
as
well
have
call
hi
pictur
``
the
never
end
love
''
or
``
love
at
first
sight
''
,
as
he
concentr
all
hi
energi
on
the
young
coupl
,
and
not
on
the
disast
itself
.

the
plot
is
anyth
but
origin
and
the
dialogu
sometim
resembl
a
televis
soap-opera
.

the
director
doe
n't
even
try
to
overcom
hi
empti
script
.

becaus
of
it
primit
and
predict
plot
,
titan
is
total
depend
on
the
visual
that
truli
ar
breathtak
.

russel
carpent
's
rich
,
majest
and
incred
detail
cinematographi
is
certainli
award-worthi
.

everyth
from
art
direct
to
visual
and
sound
effect
ar
a
top
notch
.

but
it
doe
n't
help
much
when
the
costum
ar
more
convinc
than
the
actor
who
wear
them
.

the
actor
ar
not
to
blame
,
becaus
their
charact
ar
more
like
caricatur
,
in
other
word-fake
.

jack
is
a
man
with
mani
talent
:
he
is
a
talent
artist
,
handsom
,
brave
,
honest
,
strong
,
funni
...
you
name
it
.

he
doe
n't
have
ani
dark
side
,
he
doe
n't
make
ani
mistak
,
that
for
a
second
would
make
him
human
.

jack
is
perfect
,
but
he
is-poor
.

on
the
other
hand
we
have
cal
.

he
is
a
bastard
that
treat
rose
as
an
odalisqu
and
not
as
hi
wife-to-be
.

he
lack
everyth
jack
possess
,
but
he
is
--
rich
.

thi
childish
contrast
between
the
social
class
is
on
of
those
thing
that
make
titan
noth
more
than
a
mediocr
pictur
.

cameron
know
precis
what
we
want
to
see
.

hi
film
therefor
contain
certain
minimum
to
draw
an
audienc-attract
actor
,
a
``
tragic
love
stori
''
,
beauti
visual
-lrb-
includ
expens
special
effect
-rrb-
,
a
dose
of
social
critic
,
a
fascin
histor
event
-lrb-
we
love
true
stori
-rrb-
and
last
,
but
not
least-an
incred
media
support
,
which
proclaim
an
averag
pictur
the
``
greatest
film
of
all
time
''
.

on
the
outsid
titan
look
perfect
,
but
behind
that
sparkl
curtain
of
incred
visual-is
empti-noth
to
think
about
.

the
main
weak
of
thi
film
,
which
iron
becam
it
success
,
is
simplic
.

cameron
enabl
our
basic
and
if
you
wish-primit
emot
:
love
,
hate
,
fear
and
helpless
.

everyon
understand
the
power
of
love
and
the
threat
to
our
beauti
coupl
is
likewis
imagin-a
sink
ship
.

titan
is
a
typic
hollywood
product
,
total
and
complet
depend
on
visual
perfect
to
hide
it
primit
plot
.

it
's
a
good
pictur
,
but
absolut
not
a
masterpiec
.

it
's
among
hundr
and
thousand
good
film
releas
everi
year
,
not
better
or
wors
than
the
averag
american
film
.
