mcdonald
is
a
newcom
and
a
promis
on
at
that
,
but
gleeson
ha
been
in
over
a

,
most
recent
as

,
gleeson

mcdonald

make
``

''
a

worth
take
.

the

wai
reminisc
of
anoth
``

independ
featur
,
1991
's
``
highwai
61
.
''

that
film
,
too
,
wa
a
road
movi
and
it
share
the
same
kind
of
wry
dialogu
and
humor
situat
as
mcpherson
's
tale
:
whimsic
observ
on
life
,
carefulli-craft
vignett
,
deadpan
convers
asid
,
and
scene
that
'll
make
you
laugh
out
loud
.

episod
in
which
our
good-natur
protagonist
bind
frank

peter
caffrei
-rrb-
to
a
hotel
bed
,
leav
him
with

the

remot

that
sequenc
alon
is
on
a
par
with
satan
lock
himself
out
of
hi
car
in
``
highwai
61
.
''

what
's
also
charm
about
``
i
went
down
''
is
how
the
relationship
between
buddi
and
git
develop
.

their
trip
becom
an
educ
for
both
of
them
,
but
the
wai
it
's
handl
is
neither
sappi
nor
labor
.

the
onli
thing
in
the
film
which
approach
clunki
is
the
culmin
explan
,
via
flashback
,
of
the
relationship
between
frank
and
tom
.

it
's
a
littl
too
hollywood
,
and
what
make
``
i
went
down
''
so
refresh
is
the
fact
that
it
rare
pander
to
tradit
convent
of
hollywood
gangster
movi
.

sure
it
's
gritti
--
make
that
grubbi
--
but
it
's
also
pretti
goofi
.

although
``
i
went
down
''
emphas
the
comed
element
of
di-organ
crime
,
there
ar
a
coupl
of
fairli
brutal
scene
in
keep
with
the
subject
matter
.

do
n't
let
these
deter
you
,
though
;
``
i
went
down
''
is
a
littl
gem
.

it
's
onli
plai
at
on
philadelphia-area
theater
--
and
i
suspect
it
wo
n't
be
there
for
long
--
so
catch
it
while
you
can
.

as
bunni
kelli
would
sai
:
``
no
gut

no
black
pud
