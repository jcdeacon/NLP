the

thei

if
the
plot
sound
a
bit
complic
,
it
is
.

the
phantom
menac
not
onli
introduc
an
earlier
gener
of
charact
and
an
immedi
crisi
,
but
set
up
the
foundat
for
the
event
that
will
eventu
lead
to
the
fall
of
the
republ
,
the
demis
of
the
jedi
knight
,
anakin
's
turn
to
evil
,
and
the
rise
of
the
dark
empir
of

.

but
the
complex
is
not
overwhelm
.

the
stori
move
quickli
,
with
the
onli
drawback
be
that
mani
question
,
predict
,
remain
unansw
at
the
end
of
the
film
,
set
the
stage
for
the
next
episod
.

on
of
the
reason
the
film
's
stori
seem
hazi
is
not
that
it
is
too
confus
,
but
too
unfocus
.

it
's
unclear
whose
stori
phantom
menac
is
.

in
the
origin
trilogi
,
the
movi
were
clearli
luke
's
stori
,
with
the
stori
center
around
hi
growth
from
farmboi
to
rebel
hero
to
jedi
knight
.

but
it
's
unclear
whether
thi
new
film
is
anakin
's
stori
or
obi-wan
's
.

if
thi
trilogi
is
center
on
anakin
,
it
's
a
shaki
foundat
.

lloyd
,
like
mani
child
actor
,
lack
the
subtl
act
skill
of
adult
perform
,
and
as
a
result
,
hi
charact
seem
shallow
and
unimpress
.

on
screen
,
we
see
noth
that
suggest
a
dark
side
lurk
underneath
hi
littl-boi
face
,
or
for
that
matter
,
ani
presenc
that
would
make
him
seem
so
special
that
qui-gon
is
will
to
believ
he
is
``
the
on
.
''

the
rest
of
the
cast
doe
fine
,
though
thei
often
work
with
some
iffi
dialogu
by
luca
.

neeson
is
perfect
as
an
ag
jedi
knight
.

mcgregor
is
well-cast
as
obi-wan
and
convei
a
balanc
of
youth
energi
and
calm
sensibl
.

portman
fit
the
role
of
a
young
queen
well
,
but
her
line
were
often
veri
formal
,
give
her
littl
room
to
give
her
charact
much
person
.

the
biggest
problem
with
the
phantom
menac
is
not
the
plot
or
the
charact
,
but
the
interact
between
them
.

individu
,
the
charact
in
thi
new
film
ar
no
less
develop
than
those
in
the
origin
star
war
,
and
the
storylin
is
not
more
confus
than
previou
film
in
the
seri
.

but
unlik
the
previou
trilogi
,
luca
doe
n't
do
as
good
of
a
job
plai
the
charact
off
on
anoth
.

in
star
war
,
there
were
immedi
contrast
and
memor
exchang
between
luke
and
han
,
han
and
obi-wan
,
and
leia
and
luke
.

the
ensembl
plai
off
each
other
and
immedi
show
their
distinct
attitud
and
person
.

in
the
sequenc
in
where
luke
,
han
,
and
chewbacca
attempt
to
rescu
leia
from
her
cell
on
the
death
star
,
the
audienc
learn
a
lot
about
all
four
charact
in
the
wai
thei
react
to
the
immedi
problem
and
each
other
.

there
is
no
compar
sequenc
in
the
phantom
menac
to
flesh
out
the
charact
and
their
relationship
with
each
other
.

individu
,
thei
ar
interest
charact
with
clear
motiv
and
interest
,
but
luca
develop
littl
chemistri
or
tension
between
the
them
.

thi
is
perhap
the
most
glare
weak
of
thi
film
,
and
is
probabl
the
reason
it
ha
disappoint
mani
review
.

but
despit
the
need
for
a
richer

and
stronger

the

is

the

the

each

luca
never

idea
about
the
look
of
hi

,
he
creat
rich
,
spectacular
landscap
,

most
of
the
new
special

in

trilogi
in
1997
were
chang
that
allow
him
to
give
the
earlier
movi
the
look
and
feel
that
just
were
n't
possibl
when
the
film
were
made
.

more
than
ever
,
in
thi
new
film
,
luca
'
univers
is
fill
with
a
menageri
of
creatur
,
robot
with
person
,
and
a
support
cast
of
alien
who
interact
with
the
main
charact
.

the
best
such
charact
is
watto
,
a
greedi
tatooin
junk
dealer
who
own
anakin
and
hi
mother
as
slave
.

watto
ha

that
flutter
like

.

of
all
the
comput-gener
charact
in
the
film
,
watto
is
the
best
done
and
most
enjoy
.

speak
of
comput-gener
charact
,
no
review
of
the
phantom
menac
is
complet
without
mention
the
most
controversi
figur
in
the
film
:
jar
jar
bink
.

with
more
thanminut
of
screen
time
,
jar
jar
is
the
realiz
of
georg
luca
'
dream
to
includ
a
fulli
comput-gener
charact
into
the
cast
of
the
new
trilogi
.

jar
jar
,
a
clumsi
amphibian
and
member
of
the
gungan
race
,
liter
stumbl
hi
wai
into
the
path
of
the
jedi

earli
in
the
film
and
becom
qui

.

jar
jar
usual
perform
a
comic-relief
role
in
the
film
,
lighten
scene
with
hi
mishap
and
inabl
to
stai
out
of
troubl
.

the
anim
of
jar
jar
is
nearli
seamless
,
and
he
interact
with
the
charact
throughout
the
film
as
if
he
were
realli
on
the
set
with
the
actor
.

howev
,
despit
the
technolog
magic
that
make
hi
charact
possibl
,
jar
jar
is
n't
complet
convinc
.

he
still
move
and
sound
too
much
like
a
cartoon
to
blend
into
a
scene
.

throughout
the
movi
,
jar
jar
never
transcend
a
``
roger
rabbit
''
-
like
presenc
.

you
accept
that
he
's
there
,
but
you
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
is
an
anim
charact
.

initi
,
i
found
jar
jar
annoi
,
but
grew
to
enjoi
the
humor
he
ad
to
the
film
.

on
my
second
view
of
the
film
,
jar
jar
wa
a
lot
of
fun
and
i
did
n't
mind
him
at
all
.

a
second
reason
thi
film
continu
the
fine
tradit
of
star
war
movi
is
that
the
film
is
replet
with
humor
and
small
detail
that
flesh
out
the
world
luca
creat
.

despit
all
the
film
's
struggl
between
good
and
evil
,
and
the
sober
muse
about
on
's
destini
and
``
the
forc
,
''
like
all
star
war
film
,
the
phantom
menac
never
take
itself
too
serious
.

fortun
,
luca
ha
n't
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
hi
film
ar
entertain
,
not
high
art
.

from
the
bumbl
jar
jar
,
to
a
on-man
,
two-head
announc
team
call
the
action
at
the
film
's
thrill
pod-race
sequenc
,
to
a
cameo
appear
by
e.t.
in
the
film
,
the
phantom
menac
is
simpli
a
lot
of
fun
,
with
lot
of
half-hidden
joke
and
humor
that
can
easili
be
miss
.

and
final
,
the
phantom
menac
work
becaus
,
as
in
all
hi
film
,
there
is
no
shortag
of
speed
and
action
.

from
begin
to
end
,
there
ar
light-saber
battl
,
hair-rais
chase
,
and
thrill
duel
between
good
and
evil
.

the
pod-race
sequenc
on
tatooin
is
on
of
the
most
entertain
and
excit
scene
in
ani
star
war
film
,
and
the
final
showdown
between
obi-wan
,
qui-gon
,
and
darth
maul
is
arguabl
the
best
choreograph
,
most
thrill
fight
sequenc
luca
ha
film
.

the
phantom
menac
wo
n't
win
ani
major
oscar
.

it
probabl
wo
n't
beat
titan
's
box
offic
record
.

and
it
's
not
even
the
best
star
war
film
-lrb-
i
'd
put
it
third
,
after
the
origin
and
the
empir
strike
back
-rrb-
.

but
it
's
an
excit
and
entertain
film
,
far
better
than
your
typic
summer
blockbust
.

the
film
ca
n't
live
up
to
it
's
hype-no
film
,
not
even
the
origin
star
war
,
could
have
done
that
.

but
it
's
still
worth
see
...
probabl
more
than
onc
.
