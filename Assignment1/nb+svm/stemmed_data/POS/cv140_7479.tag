:
``

so
what
,
exactli
,
is
the
fifth
element
?

after
see
luc
besson
's
ambiti
,
much-shroud-in-secreci
scienc
fiction
fantasi
,
i
could
not
help
but
be
let
down
by
the
actual
answer
,
which
is
not
nearli
as
excit
nor
clever
as
on
would
think
.

but
what
is
far
from
a
letdown
is
the
film
as
a
whole
,
a
wildli
imagin
feast
for
the
sens
that
doe
what
all
the
best
scienc
fiction
film
do
--
creat
a
univers
unlik
ani
other
present
on
the
silver
screen
.

the
biggest
ironi
of
the
fifth
element
is
that
the
on
thing
that
ha
been
kept
under
such
tight
wrap
--
the
actual
storylin
--
is
the
most
convent
,
dismayingli
so
,
element
-lrb-
pun
intend
-rrb-
of
the
film
.

speak
in
the
vaguest
possibl
term
,
the
basic
of
the
plot
ar
as
follow
:
in
the
year
2259
,
a
great
forc
of
evil
threaten
to
consum
the
earth
,
and
onli
the
four
element
--
earth
,
wind
,
fire
,
and
water
--
unit
with
a
fifth
element
can
stop
it
.

;
and
a
mysteri

-rrb-
.

all
of
the
piec
come
togeth
in
a
tidi
and
somewhat
underwhelm
--
and
unsurpris
--
fashion
,
but
there
is
no
deni
that
thi
basic
stori
hold
some
intrins
interest
.

what
remain
interest
and
excit
,
howev
,
after
brief
glimps
is
the
fascin
world
besson
ha
creat
with
product
design
dan
weil
,
director
of
photographi
thierri
arbogast
,
visual
effect
supervisor
mark
stetson
,
and
the
crew
at
digit
domain
.

the
look
is
absolut
mesmer
right
from
the
open
moment
to
the
last
.

the
frenzi
cityscap
of
new
york
,
with
it
vibrant
dai-glo
color
,
tall
build
penetr
high
into
the
cloud
,
and
the
swarm
of
car
,
cab
,
and
other
vehicl
fly
through
labyrinthian
skywai
,
is
absolut
breathtak
to
behold
,
especi
in
a
wild
car
chase
sequenc
earli
on
in
the
film
.

but
it
would
not
have
been
a
complet
captiv
vision
if
the
peopl
inhabit
the
set
were
n't
equal
as
interest
,
and
ar
thei
ever
.

in
addit
to
the
exot
menageri
of
alien
creatur
that
popul
thi
world
,
from
bulki
robot
to
dog-like
mangalor
,
the
human
ar
outfit
in
costum
by
eccentr
design
jean-paul
gaulthier
,
best
known
for
creat
madonna
's
pointi
bustier
get-up
in
her
blond
ambit
tour
.

gaulthier
's
outlandish
creation
,
such
as
a
number
worn
by
leeloo
made
entir
out
of
white
strap
,
feel
more
at
home
in
besson
's
futurist
vision
than
on
ani
fashion
runwai
in
the
world
;
thei
add
to
the
sens
of
otherworldli
about
the
film
.

while
besson
's
bold
vision
is
the
biggest
virtu
of
the
film
,
it
also
could
be
it
biggest
obstacl
to
reach
a
mass
audienc
.

for
all
it
imagin
,
certain
thing
about
the
film
mai
be
a
bit
too
quirki
and
bizarr
.

i
realli
do
not
know
what
middl
america
will
make
of
the
most
outrag
charact
of
the
film
,
rubi
rhod
-lrb-
chri
tucker
-rrb-
,
a
flamboy
disc
jockei
who
make
denni
rodman
look
conserv
--
he
make
a
raucou
entranc
dress
in
an
anim
print
dress
,
sport
a
blond
hairdo
in
the
shape
of
a
hair
dryer
,
speak
in
high
pitch
at
rapid
fire
speed
.

at
first
thi
charact
's
hyper
energi
is
funni
,
but
the
act
wear
out
it
welcom
veri
quickli
.

not
irrit
,
but
just
as
strang
,
is
a
music
number
by
blue-skin
alien
chanteus
diva
-lrb-
maiwenn
lebesco
-rrb-
,
who
sing
--
and
danc
--
an
aria
that
is
an
unlik
blend
of
classic
opera
and
techno
.

the
tune
,
as
with
the
entireti
of
longtim
besson
collabor
eric
serra
's
innov
score
,
is
haunt
,
but
it
is
also
complet
jar
.

then
there
ar
the
campi
touch
of
humor
besson
and
co-scripter
robert
mark
kamen
sprinkl
throughout
,
which
too
often
ar
silli
and
forc
;
a
comic
sexual
encount
between
rubi
rhod
and
a
flight
attend
is
highli
distract
and
not
veri
funni
,
to
boot
.

the
stori
's
weak
shine
through
in
the
climax
and
conclus
of
the
fifth
element
.

while
still
visual
and
aural
spectacular
,
the
event
detail
ar
not
as
excit
nor
power
as
thei
should
be
.

the
big
,
seriou
dramat
climax
wa
met
with
more
than
a
few
snicker
,
and
it
ambiti
strive
for
a
profund
which
the
film
had
not
even
begun
to
work
toward
.

as
such
,
at
the
end
there
is
a
sens
that
there
wa
someth
bigger
at
work
here
,
that
there
wa
still
more
left
to
be
said
about
thi
stori
and
these
charact
.

thi
suspicion
wa
confirm
by
besson
himself
,
who
told
me
in
the
lobbi
follow
the
screen
-lrb-
imagin
that
,
the
filmmak
watch
the
film
with
the
``
enemi
''
--
the
critic
-rrb-
that
what
had
made
it
to
the
screen
wa
realli
just
the
first
half
of
the
lengthi
origin
fifth
element
screenplai
and
that
the
second
half
--
now
titl
mr.
shadow
--
is
still
wait
to
be
made
.

still
,
despit
the
stori
problem
,
the
fifth
element
is
an
artist
triumph
for
luc
besson
;
rare
doe
a
filmmak
's
origin
vision
come
to
the
screen
in
all
it
audaci
,
undilut
glori
.

it
is
a
fascin
exampl
of
how
of
on
artist
's
fervid
imagin
can
transport
an
audienc
into
an
intox
fantasi
world
gener
seen
onli
in
dream
