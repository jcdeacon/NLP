follow

thei
ar
actual
alien
from
a
planet
known
as
thermia
.

thei
have
mistaken
the
``

episod
for
histor

of
actual
heroic
space
travel
.

nesmith
think
it
is
onli
an
elabor
gig
,
and
sort
of
blow
it
off
,
but
when
he
is
transport
--
or
i
should
sai
shot
--
back
to
earth
in
a
rather
celesti
manner
,
he
believ
.

next
thing
the
cast
know
,
thei
ar
be
drag
by
nesmith
to
thi
spaceship
.

of
cours
,
thei
all
think
he
is
out
of
hi
mind
and
onc
he
doe
convinc
them
that
there
realli
is
a
spaceship
,
what
thei
want
to
do
is
get
out
of
there
as
fast
as
the
transport
will
take
them
.

but
after
some
persuad
,
thei
stai
on
to
fight
the
icki
sarri
and
find
a
wai
to
provid
a
peac
exist
for
the
flail
thermian
.

i
wa
quit
surpris
how
well
thi
comedi
,
which
came
off
as
utterli
brainless
from
it
market
campaign
,
work
.

take
shot
at
both
the
obviou
and
not-so-obviou
element
of
star
trek
and
it
fandom
,
galaxi
quest
never
goe
for
cheap
laugh
,
opt
instead
for
broad
but
smart
parodi
.

noth
is
safe
--
not
the
clich
,
not
the
fan
,
not
the
absurd
taglin
--
but
on
the
other
hand
,
everyth
is
safe
,
sinc
galaxi
quest
treat
it
subject
with
utter
respect
and
sometim
even
subtl
admir
.

the
highlight
of
the
movi
is
toni
shalhoub
's
fred
a.k.a.
tech
sergeant
chen
who
,
when
in
charact
,
is
the
complet
opposit
of
scotti
from
the
origin
star
trek
.

while
scotti
,
who
wa
the
technician
for
the
enterpris
would
constantli
yell
``
i
need
more
power
down
here
captain
!
''

,
chen
's
cry
for
help
is
more
to
the
tune
of
``
the
core
,
like
,
wo
n't
take
it
or
someth
.
''

it
's
a
hoot
,
but
it
doe
n't
stop
there
:
weaver
,
whose
charact
ha
the
menial
task
of
repeat
everyth
the
comput
sai
and
rickman
,
with
hi
relentlessli
holier-than-thou
attitud
ar
n't
far
behind
.

galaxi
quest
succe
as
a
funni
parodi
of
star
trek
and
while
it
's
not
a
masterpiec
--
it
tend
to
falter
in
it
more
seriou
moment
--
it
is
immens
entertain
