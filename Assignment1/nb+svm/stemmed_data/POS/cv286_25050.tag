is
on
of
the
worst

that
could

thi
film
is
amarcord
,
1974
comedi
by
famou
italian
director
federico
fellini
,
which
later
gave
inspir
to

,
and
even
led
few
american
screen
artist
to
adopt
it
heret
view
about
benefit
of
small
town
life
.

the
film
is
base
on
the
screenplai
by
fellini
and
tonino
guerra
and
it
lack
the
plot
in
usual
sens
.

instead
we
follow

italian

through
the

amarcord

and
it
probabl
explain
why
it
is

popular
,
even
among
those
peopl
who
actual
do

in
the

the

is

so
is
the

who
rememb

after
the
premier
,
fellini
reject
ani
claim
about
autobiograph
charact
of
thi
film
,
but
it
doe
n't
matter
whether

unlik
mani
of
hi
italian
colleagu
in
1970s
,
who
had
us
1930s
period
set
to
explicitli
condemn
fascism
and
serv
fashion
polit
agenda
,
fellini
doe
n't
care
that
much
about
polit
.

lack
of
self-righteou
moral
perspect
is
compens
with
fellini
's
humanist
approach
to
hi
charact
.

each
of
them
,
regardless
of
ag
,
gender
,
social
class
or
physic
appear
,
is
given
opportun
to
express
hi
or
her
view
,
dream
and
fear
.

fellini
treat
all
those
charact
with
warmth
and
affect
,
even
when
he
paint
them
as
grotesqu
caricatur
of
real
peopl
.

becaus
of
thi
warmth
and
democrat
spirit
,
amarcord
could
be
view
as
on
of
the
most
human
film
of
20th
centuri
,
and
it
keep
it
gener
feel
good
atmospher
despit

have
mani

melanchol
and
even
tragic

.

fellini
could
n't
produc
such
effect
without
us
hi
own
directori
talent
that
gave
a
veri
person
touch
to
thi
movi
.

vignett
ar
n't
memor
becaus
of
the
charact
onli
;
fellini
us
camera
,
paint
film
in
bright
colour
,
especi
in
the
scene
that
depict
charact
's
fantasi
.

fellini
also
know
how
to
us
locat
,
whether
such
locat
happen
to
be
luxuri
hotel
,
bright-colour
beach
or
rural
countrysid
.

even
the
down-to-earth
street
of
rimini
,
where
everyon

,
get
magic

on
the
other
hand
,
lack
of
credibl
special

somewhat
diminish
the

effect
dure
the

scene
.

thi
atmospher
is
also
provid
by
incred

hi
amarcord
theme
is
probabl
on
of
the
most
recognis

most
popular
and
most
relax

uplift
piec
of

ever
produc

that
music
alon
should
be
the
reason
to
view
amarcord
as
on
of
the
indisput
classic
of
