plai
some
particularli
despic
charact
in
hi
time
,
but
everett
could
just
take
the
cake
.

he
get
my
vote
,
at
least
,
partli
becaus
`
ev
'
is
a
drunken
affair-a-week
woman
who
ha
mani
relationship
problem

veri
few
of
which
ar
with
hi
wife

dian
venora
-rrb-
.

when
hi
colleagu
at
the
oakland
tribun
is
in
an
ugli
car
wreck
and
di
,
everett
must
take
over
for
her
at
a
vital
interview
session
.

the
interview
is
with
frank
beacham
-lrb-
isaiah
washington
-rrb-
,
a
death-row
inmat
set
to
die
at
midnight

as
everett

,
he
realiz
that

veri
well
be
innoc
.

he

a
kei
wit
-lrb-
michael

with
the
potato
chip
rack
in
front
of
him
?

jeter
doe
n't
know
what
he
's
talk
about
.

eastwood
furrow
hi
brow
.

crinkl
express
and
all
,
clint
is
the
centr
of
energi
of
true
crime
.

the
film
is
by
no
mean
a
standard
action/suspens
yarn
,
but
a
thought
human
stori
in
which
the
charact
come
befor
the
shoot-out
.

isaiah
washington
ha
a
break-out
perform
as
frank
beacham
,
and
scene
with
him
and
hi
weari
wife
-lrb-
lisa
gai
hamilton
-rrb-
ar
truli
heartfelt
moment
.

but
the
best
scene
ar
on
that
featur
eastwood
duke
it
out
with
those
in
author
over
him
.

deni
leari
,
as
everett
's
editor
and
boss
,
ha
more
than
a
few
memor
moment
of
restrain
anger
-lrb-
you
see
,
ev
is
sleep
with
hi
wife
-rrb-
.

but
hand
down
,
the
most
enjoy
segment
of
the
film
ar
when
jame
wood
is
on
camera
.

plai
the
big
boss
alan
mann
,
wood
and
eastwood
creat
amus
chemistri
and
laugh-out-loud
punchlin
.

when
true
crime
opt
for
a
high-speed
chase
to
the
govern
's
hous
at
the
final
,
the
qualiti
of
film-make
take
an
abrupt
nosed
.

eastwood
wa
so
success
with
color
charact
portrait
that
he
did
n't
need
to
switch
lane
.

true
crime
is
a
tension-build
,
intrigu
drama
showcas
for
the
talent
director
and
star
.

thi
is
a
road
block
he
could
have
easili
dismiss
-lrb-
