a
dog
of
flander
is
a
delight
,
heartwarm
famili
film
that
is
sure
to
entertain
kid
of
all
ag
.

even
older
on
who
consid
themselv
too
`
sophist
'
for
kiddi
fare
will
be
surpris
to
hear
that
thi
film
is
for
grown-up
,
too
.

there
have
been
other
movi
of
thi
ilk
-lrb-
boi
and
dog
-rrb-
,
and
while
thi
on
fall
into
that
categori
,
it
is
mostli
a
stori
about
overcom
difficulti
and
find
a
good
home
for
yourself
.

move
over
or
rather
,
roll
over
old
yeller
,
thi
dog
of
flander
is
a
heartwarm
delight
.

the
cinematographi
,
courtesi
of
walther
van
den
end
is
beauti
,
and
realli
add
to
the
power
drama
of
the
film
.

it
also
give
a
feel
of
be
in
flander
-lrb-
the
whole
film
wa
respect
shot
in
flander
-rrb-
.

the
music
from
richard
friedman
is
also
remark
;
an
evoc
,
poignant
score
that
recaptur
music
from
the
19th
centuri
.

the
open
song
over
the
credit
is
veri
beauti
-lrb-
i
hope
the
soundtrack
is
avail
!
-rrb-

,
and
there
's
a
brief
excerpt
of
`
cheer
up
,
charli
'
from
willi
wonka
and
the
chocol
factori
-lrb-
sung
by
alois
,
to
nello
,
in
anoth
delight
scene
-rrb-
.

the
cast
is
first-rate
:
jess
jame
and
jeremi
jame
kissner
,
who
plai
nello
,
ar
some
of
the
most
endear
,
ador
young
star
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
whole
life
-lrb-
so
ar
the
girl
who
plai
alois
,
madylin
sweeten
as
the
younger
,
and
farren
monet
as
the
older
-rrb-
.

not
that
thei
ar
the
onli
good
star
,
howev
.

jack
warden
is
ideal
as
jehan
,
elicit
just
the
right
amount
of
humor
and
compass
requir
for
the
charact
.

-lrb-
the
scene
involv
him
and
nello
ar
heartwarm
,
touch
on
.
-rrb-

also
,
bruce
mcgill
is
charm
as
the
kindli
miller
william
.

he
's
anoth
on
of
my
favorit
charact
in
the
film
.

but
jon
voight
,
as
i
mention
befor
,
is
the
perfect
choic
for
michel
.

he
bring
a
mysteri
,
yet
gentl
perform
that
make
us
all
feel
good
again
when
he
reassur
insecur
nello
that
he
*
can
*
win
the
contest
.

but
what
make
thi
film
fun
to
watch
is
how
well-defin
the
charact
ar
,
and
the
pace
of
the
stori
-lrb-
best
of
all
,
it
ha
a
happi
end
though
i
will
*
not
*
give
it
awai
;
sorri
-rrb-
is
strong
and
power
enough
for
us
to
identifi
with
the
charact
.

for
the
first
time
sinc
the
begin
of
1999
,
there
come
a
film
which
doe
n't
reli
on
popular
formula
stuff
,
such
as
big-budget
special
effect
,
commerci
rock
soundtrack
,
or
ani
of
that
stuff
.

thi
on
reli
on
tell
a
fulli
charact-orient
stori
,
with
just
the
right
amount
of
heart
,
humor
,
and
drama
.

that
,
to
me
,
is
what
make
a
dog
of
flander
all
the
more
delight
.

eleanor
o'sullivan
of
`
the
home
new
&
tribun
'
notic
thi
,
and
wa
kind
and
gener
enough
to
welcom
it
:
`
for
want
of
a
better
word
,
a
glow
surround
a
dog
of
flander
.

it
heart
is
in
the
right
place
and
it
engag
you
.

you
can
guess
where
the
film
is
go
becaus
thi
is
well-travel
territori
,
but
with
pro
like
voight
and
appeal
young
perform
like
kissner
,
an
often-told
stori
is
well
worth
a
revisit
.
'

in
addit
,
there
were
a
coupl
of
other
enthusiast
,
such
as
chicago-sun
time
and
the
washington
post
-lrb-
you
should
read
their
review
;
thei
're
realli
posit
-rrb-
.

other
critic
,
howev
,
were
not
so
kind
.

stephen
holden
of
`
the
new
york
time
'
had
more
than
a
share
of
beat
to
lai
upon
a
dog
of
flander
via
pen
write
.

he
found
the
film
to
be
a
`
sea
of
sugari
bromid
'
and
condemn
mr.
voight
's
charact
as
`
hopelessli
wooden
adopt
an
accent
even
more
indetermin
than
the
on
he
came
up
with
for
anaconda
.
'

in
addit
,
`
entertain
weekli
'
slam-dunk
the
film
,
condemn
it
as
`
the
worst
famili
film
of
the
year
.
'

there
have
been
so
mani
other
bad
review
like
thi
,
too
.

my
suggest
:
disregard
the
critic
.

thei
just
have
a
big
problem
with
touch
famili
film
,
and
on
should
never
pai
attent
to
them
.

thi
dog
of
flander
mai
onli
be
a
littl
`
famili
'
movi
-lrb-
it
probabl
wo
n't
be
a
big
hit
in
the
style
of
titan
,
but
then
again
no
other
film
ha
been
sinc
then
-rrb-
,
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
and
of
itself
.

thi
is
a
stori
that
is
sure
to
warm
your
heart
,
and
that
is
what
realli
matter
about
a
dog
of
flander
.

it
is
also
on
of
the
better
famili
film
around
thi
year
.

none
of
the
other
film
i
have
seen
thi
year
-lrb-
though
thei
were
good
-rrb-
have
been
so
low-kei
and
touch
.

if
you
're
look
for
famili-style
entertain
,
look
no
further
than
thi
charm
boi-and-dog
yarn
.

go
see
it
while
you
still
can
,
for
as
i
mention
,
it
might
not
be
a
big
bow-wow
at
the
box
offic
for
a
long
time
.

see
it
while
you
can
.

there
is
realli
no
need
to
compar
a
multi-million
dollar
blockbust
such
as
star
war
:
episod
ith
phantom
menac
or
tarzan
,
or
even
the
iron
giant
with
a
tender
,
sweet
littl
famili
movi
.
