and
the
rest
of
the
crew
of
the
u.s.s.
enterpris
ar
back
for
their
third
out
in
the
ninth
film
base
on
the
1960
's
seri
,
star
trek
.

gone
ar
kirk
,
spock
and
mccoi
and
in
their
wake
in
the
veri
abl
and
veri
talent
cast
from
star
trek
:
the
next
gener
.

as
usual
,
a
crisi
is
brew
and
it
is
up
to
the
crew
of
the
enterpris
to
make
the
galaxi
safe
again
.

thi
time
out
the
unit
feder
of
planet
and
an
alien
race
led
by
f.
murrai
abraham
ar
try
to
move
some
colonist
off
a
planet
against
the
colonist
's
will
.

it
turn
out
that
thi
planet
is
the
fountain
of
youth
and
the
feder
and
their
alien
buddi
feel
that
is
should
be
us
for
the
good
of
everyon
and
not
just
a
few
hundr
colonist
.

of
cours
picard
feel
that
thi
sort
of
treacheri
is
wrong
,
so
he
disobei
direct
order
and
vow
to
help
protect
the
colonist
.

insurrect
is
a
lighter
movi
than
the
last
two
star
trek
film
.

the
film
focus
on
the
lofti
question
of
whether
the
right
of
societi
as
a
whole
outweigh
the
right
of
a
small
group
.

in
thi
respect
it
get
back
to
the
root
of
star
trek
by
disguis
social
commentari
as
scienc
fiction
.

it
doe
n't
do
a
bad
job
,
other
than
it
tri
to
inject
too
much
humor
into
the
stori
line
.

mani
of
the
joke
ar
your
typic
insid
star
trek-fan-onli
joke
,
while
mani
of
the
other
just
fall
flat
.

the
other
critic
that
i
had
with
the
stori
wa
that
it
ignor
common
sens
.

there
ar
onli
a
few
hundr
peopl
on
thi
whole
planet
,
why
do
thei
have
to
be
move
?

the
explan
is
that
the
planet
ha
to
be
bombard
with
deadli
radiat
so
that
thi
fountain
of
youth
effect
will
be
strong
enough
to
help
heal
f.
murrai
abraham
's
alien
who
number
onli
a
coupl
of
dozen
.

so
the
basic
stori
line
is
bad
enough
in
that
we
have
a
few
hundr
be
boot
out
for
a
few
billion
,
at
least
that
's
plausibl
.

but
in
realiti
we
have
a
few
hundr
be
move
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
dozen
,
which
make
no
sens
whatsoev
.

the
other
littl
hiccup
in
logic
is
the
inclus
of
worf
-lrb-
michael
dorn
-rrb-
,
the
trusti
klingon
.

worf
wa
on
star
trek
:
the
next
gener
,
so
thei
want
to
includ
him
in
the
film
.

no
problem
so
far
.

worf
is
now
a
charact
of
star
trek
:
deep
space
nine
,
so
the
writer
have
to
find
a
wai
to
have
him
show
up
.

in
the
last
star
trek
movi
,
first
contact
,
the
includ
worf
in
a
credibl
fashion
,
in
thi
on
,
the
writer
ar
so
lazi
that
the
complet
gloss
over
why
he
is
even
in
the
movi
.

what
littl
explan
thei
do
give
is
so
small
that
you
would
have
miss
it
if
you
were
n't
hang
on
everi
word
on
the
screen
.

my
minor
problem
with
the
movi
asid
,
star
trek
:
insurrect
doe
have
an
overwhelm
number
of
good
point
as
compar
to
it
bad
on
.

while
mani
of
the
joke
do
miss
the
mark
,
mani
ar
pretti
good
,
even
for
non-trekki
.

the
special
effect
ar
among
the
best
for
the
star
trek
seri
.

the
action
is
plenti
and
well
done
.

thi
is
a
veri
good-look
movi
.

it
should
come
as
no
surpris
to
anyon
who
ever
watch
star
trek
:
the
next
gener
that
the
act
is
first
rate
.

it
is
veri
obviou
that
these
actor
have
been
work
togeth
for
over
a
decad
.

thei
interact
with
each
other
with
a
skill
that
few
other
ensembl
cast
can
muster
.

most
star
trek
fan
probabl
will
not
be
disappoint
with
thi
latest
film
in
the
seri
.

if
you
've
alwai
hate
star
trek
,
there
is
noth
here
that
is
go
to
chang
your
mind
.

star
trek
:
insurrect
is
not
the
best
film
in
the
seri
,
but
it
is
good
enough
to
dispel
the
long
stand
tradit
of
the
odd
number
film
in
the
seri
be
far
inferior
to
the
even
number
on
.
