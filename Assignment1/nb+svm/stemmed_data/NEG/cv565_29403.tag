repris
the
oft-plai
charact
of
dash
swordsman
d'artagnon
in
director
peter
hyam
's
adventur
``
the
musket
.
''

for
some
reason
that
i
mai
figur
out
later
,
i
do
n't
know
why
the
time
,
monei
and
effort
were
put
into
the
make
of
``

''

it
mai
be
that
someon
had
the
clever
idea
of
combin
the
duma
charact
and
stori
with
the
current
enamor
with
the
action
work
of

and
yuen
woo-ping
from
``

the
result
is
a

the
result
is
