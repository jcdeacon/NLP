believ
heston
is
the

believ
me
,
we
movi
critic
have
been
think
the
same
thing
for

when
the

ap
present
the

``

and
how
do

the
absolut
most
laughabl

beach
and
yell
``
god

''

sever
time
in
success
.

the
movi
is
atroci
and
should
onli
be
view
by
those
member
of
societi
who
like
to
watch
bad
movi
and
laugh
at
them
.

what
make
planet
of
the
ap
even
more
amus
is
that
it
wa
suppos
to
function
as
some
sort
of
social
ironi
,
a
condemn
of
fundament
who
reject
the
theori
of
evolut
.

but
let
me
tell
you
,
if
darwin
could
see
the
ap
mask
and
hear
the
rotten
dialogu
exchang

-rrb-

,
he

luckili
for
