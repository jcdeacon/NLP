here
i
sit
at
my
comput
about
to
write
my
review
of
the
recent
action
comedi
``
bait
''
star
jami
foxx
and
david
mors
.

thi
is
a
review
i
do
n't
even
want
to
write
becaus
i
'd
just
be
lai
the
same
critic
on
it
that
i
would
with
ani
other
so-gener-and-predict-it
's
-
beyond-ridicul
piec
of
hollywood
fluff
.

if
thei
're
not
go
to
give
us
,
the
audienc
,
just
a
littl
credit
and
put
someth
togeth
with
half
a
brain
,
why
should
i
wast
my
time
and
mental
energi
criticis
it
?

last
summer
i
took
thi
same
approach
with
my
review
of
``
the
mummi
,
''
in
that
review
i
just
quot
phrase
my
review
of
other
sub-par
movi
.

i
think
i
shall
do
the
same
thing
here
but
with
a
few
less
quot
-lrb-
not
all
ar
applic
-rrb-
.

i
hope
thi
goe
to
show
you
what
i
think
of
``
bait
''
and
why
you
can
find
out
all
you
need
to
know
about
it
without
have
to
take
a
wild
guess
.

it
's
genuin
unfunni
-lrb-
i
,
and
the
other
audienc
member
onli
laugh
onc
dure
the
entir
two
hour
-rrb-
,
unorigin
and
unthril
.

it
's
not
so
bad
to
the
point
where
it
's
fun
to
watch
becaus
of
it
bad
and
it
's
no
so
bad
you
absolut
loath
it
and
ar
pain
by
watch
it
,
it
's
just
such
a
clich
in
and
of
itself
,
that
,
uhh
...
lost
my
train
of
thought
.
