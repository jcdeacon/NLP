in
fact
,
the
spy
who
shag
me
is
the
exact
opposit
of
the
origin
;
instead
of
refresh
the
audienc
with
on
clever
parodi
after

,
the
filmmak
bombard
us
with
us-up
,
tire
joke
taken
directli
from
the
first

take
the
scene
where
austin

a
fraction
of
the

a
similar
scene

but
here
i
wa
insult
by
it
.

did
the
filmmak
realli
believ
the
audienc
would
laugh
at
a
rip-off
?

appar
i
overestim
the
intellig
of
the
averag
movi-goer
,
consid
that
the
film
ha
pull
in
over
$
200
million
in

.

do
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
franchis
head
our
wai
?

have
said
that
,
though
,
i
still
can
not
deni
the
film
it
merit
.

the
basic
plot
wa
delightfulli
silli
enough
to
sustain
my
interest
somewhat
;
dr.
evil
-lrb-
mike
myer
,
in
the
second
of
hi
three
role
-rrb-
,
have
construct
a
time
machin
,
goe
back
to
the
year
1969
in
an
attempt
to
snatch
austin
power
's
``
mojo
''
-lrb-
do
n't
you
just
love
that
word
?
-rrb-

whilst
he
is
cryogen
frozen
.

when
austin
get
wind
of
thi
-lrb-
after
a
great
intro
explain
the
absenc
of
elizabeth
hurlei
's
vanessa
kensington
-rrb-
,
he
too
travel
back
in

to
re-claim
hi
sexual
drive
,
accompani
by
the
hot-to-trot
felic
shagwel
,
plai
by
heather
graham
.

thi
sound
stupid
,
i
know
,
but
in
the
movi
it
start
to
make
some
kind
of
weird
,
off-the-wall
sens
,
and
it
work
for
me
.

then
there
's
mini-me
-lrb-
vern
troyer
-rrb-
,
a.
.
.

petit
clone
of
myer
's
dr.
evil
,
exactli
in

.

troyer
's
persona
alon
gain
the
film
an
extra
half-star
,
contribut
to
on
particularli
hilari
scene
where
he
attempt
to
nibbl
on
hi
own
mini-mr
.

bigglesworth
.

just
try
to
ignor
the
fact
that
,
at
2
'
8
''
,
he
would
make
dr.
evil
's
height
rise
to
just
over
21
feet
.

no
matter
.

howev
,
there
ar
onli
about
four
hearti
laugh
throughout
the
entir
hour
and
a
half
-lrb-
the
most
notabl
be
the
now
infam
tent
scene
-rrb-
,
and
that
just
is
n't
enough
to
warrant
even
a
minor
recommend
.

if
there
is
in
fact
an
``
austin
power
3
''
,
thei
should
just
kill
off
secret
agent
power
and
put
the
emphasi
on
dr.
evil
and
mini-me
.

unconvent
,
ye
,
but
there
's
no
deni
that
it
'd
make
for
a
better
movi
