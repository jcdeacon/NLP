terrenc
malick
made
an
excellentminut
film
adapt
of
jame
jone
'
world
war
ii
novel
.

unfortun
,
he
buri
it
within
an
overlong
and
overreach
3-hour
long
pseudo-epic
.

thi
is
a
shame
becaus
the
film
featur
an
outstand
perform
by
nick
nolt
.

the
best
scene
is
when
nick
nolt
's
charact
,
lt.
col.
tall
,
is
forc
to
deal
with
the
direct
refus
by
capt.
staro
-lrb-
elia
kotea
-rrb-
to
execut
an
order
.

nolt
's
reaction
and
transform
mai
be
the
best
work
of
hi
career
.

had
terrenc
malick
concentr
on
the
great
perform
of
nolt
and
kotea
as
well
as
those
by
sean
penn
,
woodi
harrelson
,
and
john
cusack
,
he
could
have
made
a
truli
great
film
.

instead
,
malick
saddl
the
film
with
plod
pace
,
unnecessari
flashback
,
and
a
voic-over
narrat
all
design
to
telegraph
the
great
philosoph
underpin
of
the
stori
.

the
narrat
wa
especi
annoi
as
much
of
it
sound
like
veri
bad
high
school
poetri
.

with
a
lot
of
edit
,
the
core
stori
could
be
transform
into
a
truli
classic
war
film
.

hopefulli
,
the
dvd
version
of
thi
film
will
featur
option
to
suppress
the
narrat
,
and
perhap
will
even
provid
for
an
altern
,
shorter
version
of
the
film
.

i
