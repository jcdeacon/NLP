``
mercuri
rise
''
ha
numer
flaw
,
but
there
is
on
that
realli
stand
out
:
it
central
plot
devic
is
unnecessari
.

that
's
right
.

the
major
aspect
of
the
film
,
that
which
is
suppos
to
make
it
differ
from
other
routin
govern
conspiraci
/
action
flick
could
be
drop
from
the
begin
,
and
the
movi
would
turn
out
exactli
the
same
,
if
not
better
.

thi
central
devic
is
the
fact
that
a
nine-year-old
boi
is
autist
.

hi
name
is
simon
,
and
an
evil
govern
bureaucrat
name
nichola
kudrow
-lrb-
alec
baldwin
-rrb-
want
him
dead
becaus
he
unknowingli
crack
a
supersecret
govern
code
slip
into
the
back
of
a
puzzl
magazin
by
it
programm
just
to
see
if
someon
could
beat
it
.

simon
is
intend
to
be
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
film
,
and
we
ar
suppos
to
feel
for
him
becaus
he
is
a
poor
handicap
child
thrown
into
a
violent
,
unfair
world
against
hi
will
,
with
onli
a
renegad
fbi
agent
plai
by
bruce
willi
to
protect
him
.

the
fact
that
he
is
autist
doe
noth
for
the
emot
intens
or
the
plot
necess
of
``
mercuri
rise
.
''

i
suppos
the
origin
novel
upon
which
the
movi
wa
base
did
much
more
with
thi
aspect
of
simon
's
charact
and
hi
relationship
with
willi
,
but
here
it
is
lost
.

miko
hugh
,
the
young
actor
who
plai
simon
,
goe
through
the
prescrib
motion
of
be
autist
:
he
walk
slowli
,
drawl
hi
word
,
kick
and
scream
when
he
's
touch
,
and
ha
a
hard
time
look
at
other
peopl
.

it
's
a
difficult
role
for
an
adult
,
much
less
a
young
child
,
to
plai
,
and
unfortun
hugh
never
convinc
us
that
he
is
n't
plai
like
he
's
autist
.

unlik
dustin
hoffman
's
perform
in
``
rain
man
''
or
leonardo
dicaprio
's
in
``
what
's
eat
gilbert
grape
,
''
we
ar
alwai
painfulli
awar
that
hugh
is
act
.

howev
,
unlik
``
rain
man
''
which
us
it
charact
's
autism
in
uniqu
and
interest
wai
to
build
a
credibl
and
touch
stori
,
``
mercuri
rise
''
could
go
right
about
it
gener
,
predict
plot
with
simon
be
simpli
a
realli
smart
but
realli
shy
kid
.

hell
,
he
doe
n't
even
have
to
be
shy
.

in
fact
,
the
movi
might
have
been
more
interest
if
he
had
had
a
more
activ
role
,
rather
than
just
be
cart
around
under
willi
'
arm
.

willi
'
charact
,
art
jeffri
,
is
a
disillus
fbi
agent
who
ha
been
remov
from
undercov
work
and
is
now
do
menial
task
like
listen
to
wiretap
with
rooki
who
ar
happi
to
be
do
anyth
.

he
becom
involv
with
simon
when
he
is
call
to
check
out
a
murder
scene
at
simon
's
hous
,
where
hi
father
ha
appar
shot
hi
mother
in
the
back
and
then
commit
suicid
.

of
cours
,
we
know
that
is
n't
the
wai
it
happen
happen
becaus
we
saw
an
evil
,
squar-jaw
govern
hitman
with
a
mean-look
crew-cut
knock
off
the
parent
.

simon
wa
abl
to
get
awai
,
and
jeffri
find
him
hide
in
a
secret
compart
in
a
closet
,
which
the
rest
of
the
chicago
polic
depart
had
overlook
.

jeffri
--
who
is
accus
by
sever
charact
at
differ
time
of
be
paranoid
although
hi
action
never
suggest
it
--
know
there
is
someth
more
,
and
he
make
it
hi
person
mission
to
go
against
everyth
and
everyon
in
order
to
protect
simon
.

thi
is
quit
a
task
becaus
that
same
hitman
who
knock
off
simon
's
parent
is
crawl
everywher
,
attempt
to
kill
simon
at
the
hospit
,
on
the
highwai
,
and
everi
other
place
he
goe
.

late
in
the
movi
,
jeffri
is
forc
to
enlist
the
aid
of
a
pretti
young
woman
name
stacei
-lrb-
kim
dicken
-rrb-
who
he
meet
at
a
coffe
shop
.

of
all
the
hard-to-believ
aspect
of
the
movi
,
thi
is
the
worst
.

i
can
believ
in
the
decenc
of
the
human
heart
,
but
stacei
's
charact
is
far
too
accommod
.

not
onli
doe
she
agre
to
watch
simon
while
jeffri
run
off
to
solv
the
mysteri
,
she
let
him
into
her
apart
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morn
when
she
know
the
polic
is
after
him
,
and
then
let
him
leav
simon
in
her
apart
which
mean
that
she
ha
to
forgo
a
busi
trip
that
is
desper
need
to
pai
the
rent
.

the
grind
squeal
of
the
rusti
plot
machin
ar
almost
overbear
at
thi
point
.

the
movi
might
have
been
redeem
by
some
good
action
sequenc
,
but
even
here
``
mercuri
rise
''
doe
n't
rise
to
the
challeng
.

the
movi
wa
direct
by
harold
becker
,
who
ha
made
some
good
suspens
film
includ
``
sea
of
love
''
-lrb-
1989
-rrb-
and
``
malic
''
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
,
but
hi
talent
is
nowher
to
be
found
in
thi
latest
excurs
.

there
is
on
fight
on
a
streetcar
between
jeffri
and
anoth
hitman
-lrb-
plai
by
peter
stormar
-rrb-
that
is
so
ineptli
direct
,
shot
and
edit
,
that
i
had
no
idea
1
-rrb-
exactli
where
thei
were
on
the
streetcar
,
2
-rrb-
who
wa
hit
who
,
and
3
-rrb-
where
thi
hitman
came
from
and
how
he
knew
where
jeffri
and
simon
were
.

the
grand
final
take
place
on
the
roof
of
a
tall
build
,
and
featur
a
harrow
-lrb-
yawn
-rrb-
scene
where
simon
walk
along
the
veri
edg
of
the
build
,
not
becaus
he
ha
to
,
but
becaus
it
's
more
suspens
that
wai
.

taken
as
a
whole
,
``
mercuri
rise
''
is
an
tepid
,
confus
movi
that
lack
style
,
wit
,
and
ani
trace
of
a
sens
of
humor
.

usual
willi
bring
hi
person
brand
of
underst
humor
to
hi
role
,
but
here
he
is
too
straight
and
seriou
.

thi
is
becaus
the
movi
want
to
be
an
action
flick
and
a
heartfelt
drama
at
the
same
time
,
but
it
end
up
fail
on
both
front
.

mayb
the
book
wa
better
,
but
the
wai
it
's
handl
here
is
a
perfect
case
studi
in
formula
filmmak
guarante
to
bore
.
