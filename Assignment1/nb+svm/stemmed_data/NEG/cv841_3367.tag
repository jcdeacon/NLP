as
a
person
,
he
is
appeal
,
but
as
a
charact
,
he
becom
pretti
bore
here
.

matthew

,
is
,
quit
simpli
,
terribl
.

thi
is
n't
a
perform
good
enough
to
be
call
mail-in
;
he
even
forgot
to
put
a
stamp
on
it
.

modin
lack
ani
charm
in
an
appallingli
under-written
role
,
look
bore
most
of
the
time
,
and
get
stuck
with
a
trite
littl
speech
about
how
it
's
all
hi
father
's
fault
he
's
such
a
cad
.

carolco
's
execut
,
whose
entir
futur
is
rest
on
modin
's
bankabl
for
the
upcom
cutthroat
island
,
must
be
sweat
bucket
right
now
.

bye
bye
love
basic
come
off
as
a
veri
confus
movi
,
becaus
it
spend
far
too
much
of
it
time
on
the
new
relationship
of
it
main
charact
instead
of
on
the
relationship
between
the
father
and
their
kid
,
make
it
just
anoth
``
date
in
the
90s
''
movi
.

when
the
movi
doe
deal
with
the
children
at
all
,
it
is
to
have
on
of
them
scream
out
an
accus
and/or
cry
,
perhap
to
be
resolv
later
by
a
sensit
talk
and
a
hug
,
perhap
not
.

even
more
confus
is
a
sub-plot
featur
the
late
ed
flander
as
a
widow
who
goe
to
work
and
a
mcdonald
's
and
befriend
a
troubl
youth
.

it
is
a
sad
end
to
flander
'
career
,
get
caught
up
in
a
truli
annoi
over-us
of
mcdonald
's
as
a
locat
,
a
plot
devic
and
,
appar
,
a
major
advertis
.

even
if
bye
bye
love
had
decid
to
spend
it
time
focus
exclus
on
the
parent-child
relationship
,
it
still
would
have
been
pretti
difficult
to
pull
off
,
becaus
ultim
there
is
veri
littl
humor
on
can
wring
from
famili
break-up
and
their
effect
on
children
.

ani
wai
you
slice
it
,
it
is
a
bad
situat
for
kid
,
and
the
maker
of
bye
bye
love
mostli
go
for
the
heartstr
when
deal
with
the
singl
parent
issu
.

it
is
left
to
the
dad
'
romant
fumbl
to
probid
what
littl
humor
there
is
,
and
it
is
n't
enough
.

there
have
been
comparison
between
bye
bye
love
and
parenthood
,
but
parenthood
wa
both
genuin
funni
and
genuin
touch
.

bye
bye
love
is
a
genuin
shame
.
