movi
base
on
video
game
,
such
as
street
fighter
or
mario
bro.
,
have
never
gener
much
interest
at
the
box
offic
.

but
when
the
first
mortal
kombat
movi
came
out
in
1995
,
it
did
surprisingli
well
.

with
a
simpl
stori
,
a
pulsat
soundtrack
,
and
lot
of
awesom
choreograph
fight
scene
,
the
movi
move
quickli
and
displai
lot
of
energi
.

it
got
my
vote
for
`
the
movi
where
i
expect
the
least
and
got
the
most
'
.

and
,
if
you
have
n't
had
the
opportun
,
i
would
definit
recommend
that
you
see
it
on
video
.

in
the
world
of

kombat
,
base
on
the
popular
arcad

it
's
an
easi
enough
premis
,
but
unfortun
-lrb-
veri
unfortun
-rrb-
,
the
writer
try
to
do
too
much
with
the
movi
.

it
is
onli
a
video
game
,
after
all
,
but
the
on-screen
version
tri
to
go
beyond
it
's
comic
book
boundari
by
ad
depth
,
a
conceptu
of
self-worth
,
and
worst
of
all
,
a
love
stori
.

thi
becom
veri
awkward
,
becaus
all
of
the
player
ar
fighter
and
noth
more
.

thei
ar
likabl
and
impress
when
thei
ar
showcas
their
martial
art
and
fight
skill
,
but
look
extrem
awkward
and
uncomfort
when
thei
ar
requir
to
actual
act
.

thi
becom
embarrassingli
appar
,
for
exampl
,
as
the
movi
tri
to
develop
a
romant
bond
between
liu
kang
and
princess
kitana
.

the
origin
mk
wa
smart
in
let
the
player
do
what
thei
do
best
.

thei
spoke
littl
,
but
fought
a
lot
.

thu
,
the
movi
wa
easi
to
digest
.

howev
,
mk2
tri
to
give
these
player
a
certain
amount
of
depth
,
an
element
that
wa
lack
in
the
first
movi
,
but
the
attempt
here
fail
miser
.

thi
uneasi
feel
is
readili
appar
,
for
exampl
,
whenev
you
hear
lord
rayden
speak
.

not
onli
doe
he
talk
in
riddl
and
offer
enigmat
-lrb-
e.g.
useless
-rrb-
advic
,
but
he
speak
so
slowli
as
if
to
simul
infinit
wisdom
.

try
read
thi
half
as
fast
,
and
you
'll
hear
what
i
mean
.

but
the
movi
is
not
a
complet
fatal
.

fight
scene
ar
well-choreograph
,
highlight
by
terrif
acrobat
and
agil
.

and
player
of
the
game
will
be
reward
with
the
inclus
of
practic
everi
charact
from
the
video
game
,
although
their
screen
time
amount
to
noth
more
than
a
cameo
.

even
if
you
're
not
familiar
with
the
video
game
,
each
fighter
ha
their
own
costum
and
uniqu
weaponri
to
easili
differenti
themselv
.

but
it
's
just
too
littl
of
what
movi-goer
and
especi
fan
of
the
game
will
expect
.

oddli
,
the
inclus
of
the
human
element
actual
pollut
the
puriti
of
the
mortal
kombat
essenc
.

and
the
poor
act
result
in
a
muddl
movi
that
offer
the
view
audienc
littl
chanc
for
surviv
.

-lrb-
i
am
now
talk
veri
slowli
as

rent
the
first
