have
i
miss
anyon
?

so
,
obvious
,
not
much
ha
chang
.

thi
is
not
a
problem
,
provid
that
the
movi
boast
the
rapid-fire
hilar
and
unexpectedli
true
sentiment
of
the
origin
.

but
american
piei
the
veri
definit
of
``
sequel
.
''

it
's
coarser
,
ye
,
and
it
push
the
envelop
even
more
,
but
it
heart
is
n't
in
it
.

it
's
easi
cash
to
capit
off
the
first
film
's
success
,
but
it
would
have
been
a
worthier
invest
to
prolong
the
franchis
by
come
up
with
someth
origin
.

part
of
the
reason
why
the
film
doe
n't
work
,
i
think
,
is
that
while
in
the
origin
the
kid
'
quest
for
sex
wa
a
come-of-ag
step
stone
as
much
as
an
outlet
for
their
horni
.

here
,
everyth
ha
been
cheapen
.

thei
behav
like
those
idiot
frat
boi
who
kill
themselv
drink
;
thei
have
no
motiv
except
for
sex
,
sex
,
beer
and
sex
.

that
's
not
to
sai
that
you
ca
n't
make
a
decent
comedi
from
that
premis
,
but
it
is
on
of
american
pie
2
's
undo
.

miss
,
too
,
is
the
sweet
that
permeat
american
pie
,
the
thi-could-be-you
qualiti
of
the
main
player
.

here
,
the
charact
ar
too
awar
of
themselv
as
pop-cultur
icon
,
and
thei
're
even
more
on-note
.

stifler
and
finch
ar
now
caricatur
while
jim
,
oz
and
kevin
ar
forc
to
make
awkward
self-discoveri
at
arbitrari
moment
,
none
of
them
betrai
what
the
writer
think
the
audienc
want
to
see
.

and
then
there
's
the
soon-to-be-notori
scene
where
jim
superglu
``
himself
to
himself
,
''
which
perfectli
demonstr
yet
anoth
of
the
film
's
ailment
,
on
that
also
permeat
sai
it
is
n't
so
,
director
j.b.
rodger
'
debut
.

there
's
a
fine
line
between
comedi
and
abject
humili
,
and
american
piei
on
the
wrong
side
of
it
.

it
's
hard
to
laugh
at
the
charact
when
you
ar
profoundli
embarrass
for
them
.

i
shield
my
ey
watch
thi
more
than
i
have
watch
ani
horror
movi
.

if
there
's
on
redeem
factor
to
american
pie
2
,
it
's
the
inimit
eugen
levi
as
jim
's
dad
,
who
pop
in
on
jim
as
he
's
about
to
score
and
utter
line
like
``
your
mother
and
i
have
been
known
to
get
friski
...
not
so
much
anymor
,
but
...
''
and
then
when
the
girl
's
parent
walk
in
,
blurt
out
``
thi
must
be
your
daughter
!
''

i
did
n't
get
her
name
,
but
hopefulli
my
son
did
.
''
''

if
onli
the
rest
of
the
movi
had
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
levi
's
perform
.

thi
is
an
unworthi
sequel
to
a
gross-fest
that
brought
back
the
raunchi
teen
comedi
.

the
box-offic
of
thi
onw
should
keep
the
genr
go
strong
,
which
is
disappoint
.

the
genr
need
a
hiatu
;
filmmak
ar
get
lazi
.
