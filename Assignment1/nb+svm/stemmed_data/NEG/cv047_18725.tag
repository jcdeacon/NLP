-lrb-
there
ar
actual
some
more

-rrb-
of

's

is
brim
with

:

-lrb-
anthoni
hopkin
-rrb-
disappear
for
two
year
whilst
do
research
in

that
he
should

and
then
there
's
the
inevit
``
heartless

charact
,
in
the
form
of
donald
sutherland
who
plai
caulder

mentor

he
care
for
caulder
but
doe
everyth
he
can
to
discourag
him
from

let
's
get
on
thing
straight
:
dr.
theo
caulder
is
the
most
blatantli
incompet
psychiatrist
i
have
ever
seen
,
on
screen
or
off
.

ani
good
shrink
will
listen
to
what
hi
patient
ha
to
sai
no
matter
the
subject
becaus
ani
good
shrink
will
learn
a
great
deal
about
hi
patient
that
wai
.

not
good
old
theo
.

no
,
he
ask
purposefulli
point
question
and
when
powel
dare
to
ventur
to
anoth
subject
caulder
sai
``
we
need
to
talk
about
thi
right
now
.
''

thi
is
a
flaw
onli
in
the
sens
that
it
detract
from
instinct
's
alreadi
dubiou
credibl
;
unfortun
it
's
also
the
least
of
it
problem
.

director
jon
turteltaub
,
who
made
the
delight
john
travolta
vehicl
phenomenon
as
well
as
the
surprisingli
abov-par
cool
run
decid
to
make
thi
movi
so
shamelessli
sentiment
that
,
contrari
to
what
thi
movi
's
promot
would
have
you
believ
,
it
ha
much
more
in
common
with
patch
adam
than
with
the
silenc
of
the
lamb
.

it
's
not
the
kind
of
sentiment
that
can
almost
bring
tear
to
your
ey
-lrb-
what
dream
mai
come
aptli
demonstr
that
-rrb-
but
the
kind
that
bring
vomit
up
your
esophagu
-lrb-
excus
the
graphic
depict
-rrb-
.

it
aim
to
``
inspir
''
rather
than
to
touch
heart
.

as
yoda
would
sai
,
inspir
it
doe
not
.

it
is
the
ultim
sign
of
futil
when
a
screenwrit
-lrb-
the
veri
experienc
gerald
di
pego
-rrb-
ha
to
resort
to
liter
tell
the
audienc
a
movi
's
stori
.

inde
,
somewher
in
the
begin
of
instinct
,
on
of
the
charact
actual
read
aloud
the
film
's
plot
to
anoth
charact
.

thi
,
like
the
instanc
i
mention
in
the
first
paragraph
of
thi
review
,
is
a
horrid
insult
to
our
intellig
.

i
am
forc
to
wonder
whether
turteltaub
and
di
pego
did
not
think
that
we
could
figur
out
what
instinct
is
about
simpli
from
regular
convers
.

i
think
that
anthoni
hopkin
is
on
of
the
greatest
screen
actor
,
and
he
chew
the
sceneri
in
thi
movi
,
brilliant
as
ever
.

oscar
winner
cuba
good
jr.
on
the
other
hand
is
dread
.

hi
perform
is
at
least
part
of
what
make
hi
charact
seem
so
incap
of
be
a
shrink
.

i
like
the
gui
in
jerri
maguir
as
well
as
in
as
good
as
it
get
but
here
he
fail
to
project
ani
shred
of
credibl
or
real
feel
.

i
love
anim
,
and
instinct
's
promin
save
the
gorilla/live
in
harmoni
with
natur
theme
is
certainli
someth
i
could
sympath
with
.

howev
thi
movi
's
execut
is
complet
unaccept
.

tone
down
the
violenc
and
thi
will
be
a
chick
flick
.
