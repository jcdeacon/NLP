then
focu
all
of

not
help
matter
is
the
fact
that

have
idea
about
a

a
sexi
lawyer
-lrb-
conni
nielson
-rrb-

.

he
also
start
to
lose
control
of
hi
case
.

kevin
learn
that
all
of
hi
problem
have
been
caus
by
the
work
of
on
man
.

that
man
is
hi
boss
,
mr.
milton
,
a
truli
evil
charact
who
just
mai
be
the
devil
himself
.

kevin
must
somehow
confront
milton
and
thwart
whatev
diabol
plan
he
ha
in
store
.

but
how
do
you
defeat
the
devil
?

why
is
it
that
most
courtroom
scene
in
the
movi
ar
absurd
?

do
filmmak
realli
believ
that
``
normal
''
courtroom
drama
doe
n't
fit
the
bill
and
thei
have
to
juic
them
up
?

the
courtroom
scene
in
thi
movi
would
never
happen
in
a
real
courtroom
,
which
would
n't
have
been
too
bad
if
it
were
n't
keanu
reev
try
to
pull
it
off
.

i
give
reev
credit
for
try
hard
,
but
throughout
the
movi
i
never
saw
the
kevin
lomax
charact
,
just
an
actor
try
veri
hard
to
plai
kevin
lomax
and
come
up
short
.

charliz
theron
defin
the
term
``
over-the-top
''
in
her
perform
as
mari
ann
lomax
,
a
disappoint
in
contrast
to
her
good
perform
in
``
2
dai
in
the
vallei
''
.

the
onli
good
perform
in
the
movi
is
by
al
pacino
,
but
i
kept
ask
myself
what
the
heck
he
wa
do
in
thi
mess
?

mayb
he
felt
it
would
be
interest
plai
the
devil
,
and
you
can
tell
he
is
have
fun
do
so
,
but
hi
skill
as
an
actor
can
not
save
the
poor
perform
and
lacklust
script
that
surround
him
.

it
's
pretti
standard
stuff
,
includ
the
fact
that
the
hotshot
lawyer
appear
to
be
the
onli
compet
person
on
the
planet
who
can
do
anyth
right
in
the
courtroom
.

pleas
read
no
further
if
you
do
not
want
the
end
spoil
,
but
i
have
to
get
someth
off
of
my
chest
.

in
1986
i
rememb
watch
a
movi
call
``
wisdom
''
with
emilio
estevez
and
demi
moor
,
and
the
end
of
that
film
did
the
worst
possibl
thing
that
a
movi
could
do
.

what
i
like
to
call
``
guess
what
,
it
wa
all
a
dream
''
scenario
.

in
``
wisdom
''
the
two
lead
charact
ar
kill
at
the
end
,
onli
to
have
on
of
the
charact
``
wake
up
''
from
an
appar
and
sai
``
gosh
,
i
'm
glad
that
did
n't
realli
happen
!
''
.

i
consid
it
inexcus
the
wai
the
audienc
wa
toi
with
.

well
,
the
same
thing
happen
in
``
the
devil
advoc
''
,
and
although
argument
could
be
made
surround
whether
it
wa
actual
a
dream
-lrb-
perhap
milton
went
back
in
time
to
try
a
differ
rout
for
hi
plan
,
sinc
it
fail
and
he
is
the
devil
-rrb-
,
but
the
point
is
that
the
last
90
%
of
the
film
did
n't
happen
.

i
know
it
's
a
stretch
,
after
all
it
is
a
movi
and
noth
realli
happen
,
but
i
just
get
annoi
to
get
toi
with
like
that
.

of
cours
,
the
dream
end
could
almost
be
forgiven
if
the
stori
that
preced
it
wa
at
least
an
interest
on
.

as
i
recal
,
``
wisdom
''
wa
a
decent
film
.

``
the
devil
's
advoc
''
is
not
.
