``

a
pastich
,
and
not

i
find
it
extrem
tell
that
the
most
engag
part
of
the
film
is
the
credit

a
jawbreak
factori
montag
inexplic

,
the
song
ha
absolut
noth
to
do
with
the
footag

rebecca
gayheart
,
follow
role
in
``
scream

should
have

credibl
she
might
have
gotten
from
her
role
in
quentin
tarantino
's
``

and
rose

should
just
quit

she
ha
no

no

and
no

other
than
roll

to
be
upstag
by

rocker
marilyn
manson
,
whose
fifteen

that

``

``

is
a
monument
wast

quit
like
on
of
the
singl
worst

to
call

would
be
to
insult

bad
flick
for
the

of
the
year
ar
safe
;
i
've
alreadi
got
my
pick
for
worst
film
of
'
99
.

``
jawbreak
''
run
approximatelyminut
,
though
it
feel
longer
than
``
titan
''
,
and
is
rate
r
for
languag
,
sexual
situat
and
graphic
violenc
.

not
recommend
for
