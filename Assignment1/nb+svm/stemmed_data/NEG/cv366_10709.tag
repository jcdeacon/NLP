comment
:
track
of
a
killer
had
a
coupl
of
strike
against
it
befor
i
even
began
watch
it
.

strike
on
wa
the
fact
that
someon
had
scrawl
the
word
garbag
on
the
videotap
's
sticker
in
black
marker
-lrb-
not
typic
a
good
sign
when
you
rent
a
film
-rrb-
.

strike
two
came
while
the
preview
plai
.

did
you
ever
get
a
sink
premonit
about
a
movi
's
qualiti
-lrb-
or
lack
thereof
-rrb-
while
watch
the
trailer
that
come
befor
it
?

well
,
the
cheesi
film
be
advertis
befor
track
of
a
killer
were
film
that
no
on
ha
ever
heard
of
star
peopl
no
on
know
,
and
thei
all
look
bad
-lrb-
defin
not
a
good
sign
-rrb-
.

track
of
a
killer
itself
complet
the
strikeout
.

about
the
onli
posit
thing
thi
film
had
go
for
it
wa
the
fact
that
it
sport
some
nice
sceneri
.

to
be
fair
,
the
first
half-hour
or
so
promis
at
least
a
watchabl
thriller
.

wolf
larson
,
who
bear
more
than
a
pass
resembl
to
hugh
grant
,
adequ
plai
the
underl
obvious
set
up
as
the
killer
of
the
film
's
titl
.

jame
brolin
and
kelli
lebrock
seem
equal
adequ
as
the
love
coupl
larson
will
later
threaten
.

brolin
's
charact
,
for
some
inexplic
reason
,
think
it
a
great
idea
to
spend
some
time
in
a
cabin
,
practic
isol
,
with
lebrock
and
larson
,
whom
he
's
decid
to
test
for
the
week
befor
give
him
full
control
of
hi
compani
.

by
the
time
the
charact
arriv
at
the
cabin
,
thi
film
begin
to
becom
tediou
.

appar
,
brolin
's
successor
's
test
involv
chop
wood
for
the
fireplac
and
ski
,
which
do
n't
seem
like
attribut
necessari
to
run
a
busi
in
the
citi
.

but
,
then
again
,
what
do
i
know
about
busi
?

i
do
think
,
though
,
that
thei
should
have
invest
in
some
better
furnitur
for
the
cabin
;
it
bed
and
closet
have
a
habit
of
just
break
at
the
slightest
touch
.

larson
's
charact
accid
kill
hi
own
wife
rather
than
the
coupl
he
want
to
kill
.

thi
leav
the
movi
with
an
hour
to
go
and
onli
three
charact
,
which
realli
is
n't
enough
to
sustain
it
.

the
film
's
writer
must
have
taken
a
cue
from
stephen
king
,
as
scene
from
track
of
a
killer
seem
lift
out
of
miseri
and
gerald
's
game
.

larson
and
lebrock
fight
and
tortur
each
other
-lrb-
the
tabl
get
turn
a
coupl
of
time
-rrb-
while
brolin
tramp
around
in
the
snow
look
for
help
.

some
old
gui
's
around
too
,
just
so
the
killer
can
add
to
hi
bodi
count
without
kill
the
coupl
,
who
everyon
know
will
be
aliv
at
the
end
of
the
film
.

the
old
gui
,
howev
,
miracul
surviv
hi
first
death
and
appear
later
to
be
kill
again
by
the
killer
in
a
scene
so
ludicr
it
's
worthi
of
a
chuckl
or
two
.

outsid
of
that
chuckl
,
unfortun
,
track
of
a
killer
will
just
bore
you
as
the
obviou
plot
is
drawn
out
ad
infinitum
and
the
actor
,
for
some
reason
,
becom
increas
obnoxi
.

if
you
're
in
a
video
store
and
think
about
rent
thi
turkei
,
do
n't
.

make
track
to
a
far
superior
suspens
film
,
like
miseri
.
