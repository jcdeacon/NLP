least
bit
touch
.

doe

surpris

sinc

studio

who
is
on
a
current
streak
of
on
bad
film
after

``
frosti
the
snowman
,
''
is
a
classic
cartoon
,
and
the
idea
of
a
snowman
that
is
aliv
work
splendidli
when
anim
,
but
as
a
live-action
film
,
it
doe
n't
work
at
all
.

after
a
somewhat
promis
prologu
in
which
the
frost
famili
is
establish
,
``
jack
frost
,
''
quickli
goe
downhil
,
especi
onc
the
snowman
come
into
plai
.

sinc
jack
ha
been
deceas
for
a
whole
year
,
you
would
think
there
would
be
mani
question
to
ask
him
,
such
as
,
``
what
happen
after
you
die
?
''

or
,
``
how
doe
it
feel
to
be
a
snowman
?
''

but
instead
,
the
film
focus
on
a
snowbal
fight
subplot
and
an
inevit
oversentiment
climax
that
could
be
telegraph
befor
i
even
sat
down
to
watch
the
movi
.

the
perform
ar
respect
enough
,
but
no
on
deserv
to
be
punish
by
appear
in
a
silli
film
like
thi
.

michael
keaton
at
least
got
off
easi
,
sinc
he
disappear
after
the
first
twenti
minut
,
but
what
exactli
doe
he
think
he
is
do
with
hi
career
here
?

i
have
alwai
like
kelli
preston
.

she
is
clearli
a
talent
,
charismat
actress
,
but
ha
never
been
given
a
good
role
in
her
life
,
usual
have
to
settl
for
a
on-dimension
support
charact
,
as
in
,
1997
's
,
``
noth
to
lose
,
''
and
,
``
addict
to
love
.
''

joseph
cross
wa
probabl
the
highlight
in
the
cast
,
sinc
he
believ
portrai
a
boi
suffer
the
loss
of
a
parent
.

in
on
of
the
onli
subplot
that
actual
work
,
due
to
it
witti
,
henri
rollin
is
highli
amus
as
a
hockei
coach
who
becom
terrifi
and
paranoid
after
see
the
live
snowman
.

thi
brief
hint
of
clever
is
push
to
the
side
,
howev
,
by
the
tri-and-true
main
plot
at
hand
,
which
is
the
sappi
stori
of
a
father
and
son
.

sinc
i
knew
what
wa
go
to
happen
by
the
time
the
conclus
came
around
,
i
had
no
choic
but
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
painfulli
insipid
,
cring-induc
line
of
dialogu
.

some
of
my
favorit
wa
an
interact
between
the
son
and
father
:
``
you
da
man
,
''
sai
charli
.

``
no
,
i
da
snowman
,
''
repli
jack
.

or
how
about
thi
littl
zinger
,
come
from
a
school
bulli
that
miracul
becom
friendli
toward
charli
and
tri
to
help
him
out
:
``
snowdad
is
better
than
no
dad
.
''

do
peopl
realli
get
paid
in
hollywood
for
write
piec
of
trash
like
thi
?

the
snowman
,
creat
by
john
henson
's
creatur
shop
,
is
more
believ
than
the
snowman
from
last
year
's
unintention
hilari
direct-to-video
horror
flick
,
also
call
,
``
jack
frost
,
''
but
it
still
wa
difficult
to
tell
if
it
wa
a
person
in
a
suit
or
comput
effect
.

either
wai
,
it
wa
an
aw
lot
of
work
to
go
through
,
just
to
come
up
with
a
final
product
as
featherbrain
as
thi
project
.

as
a
season
holidai
pictur
,
``
jack
frost
,
''
is
pretti
much
a
clunker
.

a
better
christma
film
from
thi
year
is
,
``
i
'll
be
home
for
christma
.
''

better
yet
,
my
suggest
would
be
to
stai
home
and
watch
a
qualiti
film
,
such
as
,
``
it
's
a
wonder
life
,
''
``
a
christma
stori
,
''
or
,
``
prancer
.
''

``
jack
frost
,
''
is
an
earnest
,
but
sever
misguid
film
,
and
children
,
as
well
as
adult
,
deserv
better
.

i
doubt
thei
would
want
to
see
a
movi
about
the
death
of
a
parent
,
anywai
.
