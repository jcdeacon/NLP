as
a

biopic
of

queen
joan
crawford
wa
turn
into
the

of
the
year
.

in
a
desper
attempt
to
capitalis
on
thi
unexpect
turn
of
event
,
some
public
hack
dream
up
outrag
print
advertis
scream
:
``
mommi
dearest
:
the
biggest
mommi
of
them
all
!
''
.

execut
at
paramount
were
appal
and
soon
had
the
ad
withdrawn
,
but
it
wa
all
too
late
.

mommi
dearest
wa

unfortun

fay
dunawai

energet
,
at

ridicul

is
about

base
on
daughter
christina
crawford
's
trashi
biographi
,
mommi
dearest
chronicl
a
seri
of
mainli
privat
event
in
the
life
of
her
moviestar
mother
.

if
you
believ
thi
movi
,
it
wa
a
life
wa
rack
by
obsess
,
lonli
,
child
abus
and
rampant
egomania
.

the
film
begin
with
crawford
adopt
two
children
,
and
conclud
in
the
offic
of
her
lawyer
where
her
now
grown-up
daughter
and
son
find
out
thei
have
been
left
out
of
their
mother
's
will
.

joan
alwai
want
her
kid
to
be
abl
to
fend
for
themselv
,
you
see
.

but
that
's
about
the
onli
thread
in
the
narr
that
manag
to
surviv
to
the
film
's
end
.

the
script-labour
over
by
four
writer
,
a
bad
sign
in
itself-is
a
poorli
connect
seri
of
episod
that
build
littl
dramat
momentum
.

frank
perri
's
direct
is
no
more
than
compet
,
and
dunawai
's
bitchi
line
asid
,
the
dialogu
is
flat
and
uninvolv
.

in
fair
,
the
film
's
second
half
ditch
some
of
the
cartoon
hyster
and
doe
develop
a
degre
empathi
for
it
charact
.

when
the
adult
christina
move
out
of
home
into
her
own
modest
dwell
,
joan
visit
and
keep
in
touch
,
not
help
her
financi
but
encourag
christina
's
own
act
and
career
ambit
.

crawford
doe
seem
to
care
about
her
daughter
,
but
you
can
sens
the
emot
distanc
and
feel
some
of
their
pain
.

you
also
get
glimps
of
what
the
film
could
have
been
in
the
hand
of
better
writer
.

ah
,
but
there
is
dunawai
's
perform
.

and
what
a
delici
piec
of
camperi
it
often
is
.

have

.

she
ha

the
kid
out
of
bed
to
come
down
and
clean
up
the
mess
she
's
make

spot
a
young
tree
she
doe
n't
like
the
look
of
,
she
turn
to
the
trembl

and
utter
the
immort

``

''

fetch

!!

``

''

in
the
film
's
most
outrag
scene
,
joan
realis
that
some
of
her
daughter
's

oh

sound
like
the
perfect
excus

thi
time
she
give
her

horribl
beat
while

anoth
classic
outburst
:
``

and
later
,
when
the

then
,
but
if
that
's
not
you
're
cup
of
tea
then
mommi
dearest
doe
n't
have
too
much
to
recommend
it
