after
an
ill-fate
bar-room
brawl
.

the
prison
scene
ar
accompani
by

,
in
a
languid
southern
drawl
,
describ
prison
life
to
hi
wife
back
home
and
offer
simpl
homili
for
the
daughter
he
ha
never
met

if
the
scene

you
a
tickl
of
familiar
,
it
probabl
should
.

cage
appear
to
realiz
that
con
air
is
go
to
be
utterli
dim-wit
and
ridicul
,
and
that
he
's
go
to
have
to
do
someth
to
keep
himself
entertain
.

and
thu
he
slip
into
a
familiar
,
surreal
role
as

proceed
--
cage
plai
cameron
poe
as
a
buf-up
version
of
rais

cage
should
have
known
what
he
wa
get
himself
into
.

he
got
a
paycheck
from
jerri
bruckheim
last
year
for
the
rock
,
and
if
there
's
on
thing
you
can
count
on
from
a
bruckheim
product
-lrb-
even
without
hi
late
partner
don
simpson
-rrb-
,
it
's
that
you
can
count
on
see
everyth
you
saw
in
the
_
last
_
bruckheim
product
.

the
critic
differ
between
the
rock
and
con
air
is
cage
's
perform
.

in
the
rock
,
cage
appear
to
be
have
the
time
of
hi
life
jump
into
the
action
frai
for
the
first
time
.

that
sens
of
discoveri
ha
been
replac
by
a
wry
self-awar
.

while
the
plot
of
con
air
find
poe
a
parole
on
board
a
hijack
prison
transport
plane
whose
goal
is
just
to
get
home
,
cage
's
goal
is
differ
but
just
as
simpl
:
to
get
out
of
the
film
with
some
measur
of
digniti
intact
.

audienc
,
too
,
should
know
what
thei
're
get
themselv
into
with
a
bruckheim
product
.

in
fact
,
the
market
peopl
ar
count
on
it
.

no
on
who
loath
the
rock
for
it
swear-grunt-blast
repetit
will
be
convert
by
con
air
;
no
on
who
love
the

the

reason
will
be

what
he
doe
n't
deliv
is
a
moment
of

.

a

ha
no

for
hitchcock

notion
that
show

creat
a

if

thei
might
have
done
someth

in

con

usual
opt
for

too
much
of

it
is
that

perhap

all
