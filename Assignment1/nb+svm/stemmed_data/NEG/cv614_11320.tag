``
flubber
''
is
the
second
best
exampl
of
how
to
take
all
the
life
out
of
a
film
remak
an
adapt
,
and
hyster
enough
both
were
distribut
by
disnei

it
's
the
kind
of
film
that
mai
be
slightli
entertain
to
tini
kid
,
but
anyon
els
will
feel
left
out
as
it
's
bore
,
slow
,
and
incred
lifeless
.

what
could
be
a
film
with
cinemat
magic
is
instead
dead
in
the
water
,
and
it
's
a
shame
becaus
it
could
have
been
a
great
film
.

``

''
as

is
a
remak
of
the
disnei
classic

and
sever
``

moment
,
like
a
big
rumba
with

yuckiti-yuck
.

what
's
most
pathet
about
thi
film
is
how
dull
it
is
.

you
do
n't
need
to
be
a
cynic
colleg
student
to
be
abl
to
see
right
through
thi
film
,
which
is
anoth
in
a
long
line
of
cheap
attempt
at
make
a
quick
buck
by
disnei
,
who
have
essenti
becom
the
puff
daddi
of
the
film
industri
,
half-assedli
re-mix
classic
-lrb-
or
non-classic
-rrb-
for
distribut
to
the
gener
public
,
who
sadli
eat
it
all
up
.

earlier
in
'
97
,
thei
releas
``
jungl
2
jungl
,
''
an
adapt
of
a
realli
aw
french
film
,
``
un
indien
dan
la
vill
,
''
which
,
yeah
,
improv
over
the
origin
,
but
not
by
much
.

disnei
's
in
about
as
bad
shape
as
warner
brother
right
now
,
onli
creativ
.

in
the
rush
to
ship
out
a
film
for
distribut
,
disnei
ha
forgotten
to
give
thi
film
a
littl
thing
call
``
magic
.
''

such
scene
as
danc
flubber
,
a
fly
car
,
a
basketbal
team
that
pretti
much
suck
fly
all
around
thank
to
some
carefulli
place
flubber
,
and
an
elabor
end
all
fail
to
amaz
,
delight
,
or
even
caus
peopl
to
laugh
.

i
sat
there
the
entir
film
stone
face
,
chuckl
perhap
twice
,
and
shake
my
head
at
all
the
bad
joke
.

who
could
realli
laugh
at
a
scene
where
philip
enter
the
wrong
classroom
and
start
teach
chemistri
?

did
n't
think
so
.

it
doe
n't
help
that
our
protagonist
is
essenti
unfunni
or
even
realli
respect
.

philip
is
not
a
lovabl
absent
mind
professori
,
just
a
realli
dumb
man
be
plai
by
robin
william
.

william
is
a
brilliant
comic
actor
...
okai
,
a
brilliant
actor
in
gener
,
but
here
he
's
given
veri
littl
to
do
but
occasion
get
hyper
over
someth
,
and
other
time
act
sad
.

those
time
,
he
's
not
bad
.

but
what
ar
we
suppos
to
think
of
a
man
who
's
forgotten
hi
wed
thrice
?

mayb
it
wa
funni
and/or
respect
in
the
60s
...
i
like
disnei
,
and
i
usual
enjoi
their
film
,
not
onli
anim
but
live
action
,
and
their
recent
film
-lrb-
save
for
``
hercul
,
''
which
wa
good
,
but
not
great
-rrb-
have
been
wors
than
lacklust
,
thei
've
been
pathet
.

``
jungl
2
jungl
''
is
probabl
the
worst
film
i
saw
last
year
.

``
flubber
''
's
probabl
second
.

what
do
thei
need
to
do
?

perhap
creat
someth
new
.

get
writer
who
can
write
someth
that
's
univers
entertain
.

film
like
``
the
parent
trap
''
and
``
mari
poppin
''
ar
film
that
ar
live
action
-lrb-
or
in
the
latter
case
a
mix
of
both
-rrb-
,
but
even
i
can
still
watch
them
becaus
thei
're
not
onli
written
to
be
magic
to
children
,
but
to
be
fun
to
adult
.

what
's
more
tortur
that
take
a
child
to
a
film
that
insult
you
and
annoi
you
at
everi
turn
?

and
my
god
,
could
n't
thei
have
done
someth
els
with
edi
mcclurg
?
