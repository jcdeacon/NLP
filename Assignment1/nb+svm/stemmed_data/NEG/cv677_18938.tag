in
short
,
a
clich-ridden
formula
film
.

welcom
to
my
review
of
the
gener
's
daughter
.

an
undercov
armi
detect
and
a
rape
counselor
find
themselv
lock
insid
an
investig
into
some
bigwig
gener
daughter
's
rape
,
tortur
and
murder
.

thei
must
delv
through
all
of
the
unspoken
armi
rule
and
the
hush-hush
,
to
figur
out
the
conspiraci
behind
the
shock
murder
.

by

thi

for
a
coupl
of
hour
,
float
around
,
goe

hopefulli
never

it
is
so
predict
that
even
a
blind

could
see
it
plot
point
come
a
mile
awai
.

it
's
as
suspens
as
a

it

as
action-pack
as
a
canadian

it

too
bad
that
it

plot
,
and
to
break
down
each
