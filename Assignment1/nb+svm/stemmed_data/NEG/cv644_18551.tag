critiqu
:
i
've
been
wait
for
a
good
witch
movi
for
a
while
now
,
but
hold
on
to
your
broom
and
incant
,
caus
thi
puppi
is
far
from
be
it
!

for
a
film
that
ha
the
word
``
magic
''
in
it
titl
,
thi
movi
contain
veri
few
moment
of
magic
...
or
humor
for
that
matter
,
drama
,
suspens
,
or
romanc
.

well
actual
,
there
is
some
manufactur
romanc
within
a
plot
that
is
so
muddl
,
it
never
let
you
in
on
whether
it
's
a
comedi
,
a
drama
,
a
horror
show
,
or
a
murder
mysteri
.

or
mayb
it
's
a
romanc
,
eh
?

it
doe
n't
realli
matter
,
caus
the
charact
in
the
film
ar
so
bore
and
uninterest
,
that
you
have
absolut
no
basi
on
which
to
care
for
them
,
or
the
film
as
a
whole
.

if
onli
the
filmmak
had
spent
as
much
time
on
the
plot
as
thei
did
the
sinfulli
obviou
soundtrack
,
thi
film
might
've
had
a
chanc
to
be
more
than
what
it
is
now
.

which
is
an
unentertain
,
crappi
film
that
us
the
witch
angl
as
a
diversionari
tactic
to
weav
us
awai
from
it
grab-bag
of
stupid
voic-over
,
overdon
song
,
melodramat
romanc
,
undevelop
stori
and
uneven
act
.

i
onli
wish
that
i
could
make
that
on
hour
and
forti-five
minut
of
my
life
re-appear
,
but
ala
,
it
is
lost
in
the
spiritu
world
of
``
interest
idea
gone
wildli
awri
