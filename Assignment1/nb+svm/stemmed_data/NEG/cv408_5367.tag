to
find
franc
plaster
with

,
sinc
the

--
the
prequel
to
david
lynch
's
cult
televis
seri
--
wa
plai
in
a
fanci
,
thx
theater
.

unfortun
,
the
theater
wa
far
more
impress
than
the
movi
,
which
absolut
stink
,
much
like
a
french
lavatori
.

wors
,
actual
.

fire
walk
with
me
-lrb-
direct
by
lynch
-rrb-
will
be
complet
incomprehens
to
anyon
who
ha
not
seen
the
tv
seri
or
read
``
laura
palmer
's
secret
diari
.
''

for
``
twin
peak
''
junki
,
like
me
,
the
movi
is
onli
margin
improv
.

the
plot
is
jumbl
and
illog
,
not
to
mention
excruciatingli
sluggish
.

the
first
30
minut
,
which
have
almost
noth
to
do
with
the
main
stori
line
,
featur
chri
isaak
and
kiefer
sutherland
as
fbi
agent
investig
a
murder
in
portland
,
oregon
.

the
movi
then
stop
in
philadelphia
for
a
nonsens
cameo
by
david
bowi
and
a
brief
appear
by
kyle
maclachlan
as
dale
cooper
.

lynch
then
drop
thi
plot
strand
altogeth
and
abruptli
shift
the
set
to
twin
peak
,
washington
--
on
year
later
.

ah
,
twin
peak
:
``
familiar
territori
,
''
you
think
to
yourself
as
angelo
badalamenti
's
distinct
music
score
chime
in
.

wrong
!

the
movi
prove
that
you
realli
ca
n't
go
home
again
,
or
at
least
lynch
ca
n't
.

onli
about
a
quarter
of
the
charact
from
the
tv
seri
appear
in
the
movi
:
leland
palmer
,
bobbi
brigg
,
jame
,
shelli
,
leo
,
the
log
ladi
and
a
few
other
--
mostli
in
meaningless
cameo
.

the
rest
of
the
``
twin
peak
''
cast
is
nowher
to
be
seen
,
and
consequ
,
lynch
fail
to
recreat
the
spirit
and
flavor
of

as
she

the
night
of
laura
's
death
,
which
is
truli
terrifi
,
is
the

we

off

and
ran
into
