the
basketbal
diari
ha
been
bounc
around
as
a
project
for
year
,
but
the
stick
point
ha
alwai
been
that
jim
carrol
as
a
charact
wa
too
unsympathet
and
too
much
a
loner
.

screenwrit
bryan
goluboff
creat
the
three
charact
who
act
as
carrol
's
poss
,
result
in
a
jim
carrol
who
is
just
as
unsympathet
,
but
now
with
equal
unsympathet
friend
.

as
a
film
,
the
basketbal
diari
mai
be
intend
primarili
as
a
cautionari
tale
,
a
100
minut
long
``
just
sai
no
''
public
servic
announc
,
but
as
drama
it
is
monument
ineffect
becaus
it
is
imposs
to
care
much
about
anyon
in
the
movi
.

jim
is
sort
of
a
jerk
even
befor
he
becom
a
junki
,
but
i
suppos
that
hi
pseudo-sensit
poetri
and
hi
devot
to
hi
termin
ill
friend
ar
intend
to
balanc
that
out
.

perhap
we
ar
expect
to
see
jim
as
on
of
those
``
good
kid
who
fall
in
with
the
wrong
crowd
''
that
everi
parent
believ
hi
or
her
troubl
child
to
be
;
i
saw
him
simpli
as
part
of
the
bad
crowd
.

without
a
charact
who
chang
in
ani
appreci
wai
,
the
basketbal
diari
rapidli
degener
into
a
collect
of
crime
commit
by
jim
and
hi
strung-out
cohort
,
all
choreograph
to
an
oppress
loud
soundtrack
.

director
scott
kalvert
doe
n't
have
mani
scene
with
intrins
dramat
impact
with
which
to
work
,
so
he
substitut
silli
slow-motion
photographi
,
self-conscious
funki
camera
angl
and
choppi
edit
.

on
onli
on
occas
,
when
a
steadi
pan
around
a
room
where
jim
is
try
to
detox
make
it
appear
that
the
wall
ar
close
in
,
ar
ani
of
the
gimmick
effect
.

mostli
,
thei
just
draw
attent
to
how
hollow
the
stori
is
.

thei
also
do
n't
allow
leonardo
dicaprio
's
perform
to
be
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
.

for
everi
impress
moment
,
like
hi
desper
attempt
to
get
hi
mother
to
give
him
monei
,
there
is
a
scene
where
kalvert
pull
too
much
of
the
focu
to
hi
own
camera
theatric
.

dicaprio
is
most
effect
when
he
is
plai
off
other
actor
,
particularli
a
fine
sequenc
featur
erni
hudson
as
an
ex-junki
who
tri
to
help
jim
straighten
out
,
but
kalvert
wo
n't
let
charact
interact
defin
thi
stori
.

he
want
to
turn
dicaprio
into
a
rock
star
,
shoot
him
in
dramat
fashion
but
deni
him
the
opportun
to
do
much
act
.

at
isol
moment
,
the
basketbal
diari
is
a
fine
showcas
for
dicaprio
's
talent
.

far
more
frequent
,
it
look
like
kalvert
is
try
to
imagin
what
a
long
form
velvet
underground
video
might
have
look
like
.
