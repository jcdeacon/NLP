okai
,
bear
with
me
y'
all
,
caus
first
off
i
have
to
get
thi
off
my
chest
:
what
the
hell
is
up
with
that
damn
crab
???
whew
.

okai
.

caus
that
same
clip
shown
over
and
over
again
wa
begin
to
get
on
my
nerv
toward
the
end
,
as
cute
as
the
crab
mayb
.

even
i
know
that
you
need
more
footag
than
that
.

and
that
wa
n't
the
onli
thing
get
on
my
nerv
.

the
cutesi
gimmick
,
saccharin
sweet
score
/
soundtrack
and
the
pretti
young
face
of
sarah
michel
gellar
-lrb-
as
amanda
-rrb-
and
sean
patrick
flanneri
-lrb-
as
tom
-rrb-
might
have
held
some
appeal
dure
,
oh
,
sai
the
firstminut
of
the
movi
.

at
first
the
movi
move
along
at
a
quick
,
interest
pace
.

it
is
speedili
establish
that
someth
magic
is
about
to
happen
to
amanda
when
she
encount
a
total
random
fairi
godfath
type
person
on
the
street
,
whose
aforement
crab
follow
her
everywher
and
just
doe
n't
die
.

a
ridicul
concept
,
ye
,
but
at
thi
point
i
'm
will
to
accept
it
becaus
i
'm
will
to
accept
that
thi
is
how
amanda
's
life
is
chang
,
how
her
power
ar
receiv
.

later
on
,
the
movi
ca
n't
seem
to
decid
whether
these
power
come
from
thi
fairi
godfath
or
from
amanda
fall
in
with
tom
.

and
thi
is
why
the
clip
of
the
crab
were
annoi
;
thei
were
n't
just
repetit
,
thei
were
out
of
place
and
unnecessari
.

the
plot
stumbl
along
at
an
uneven
speed
,
sometim
dwell
too
long
on
a
particular
develop
-lrb-
amanda
suddenli
becom
a
great
chef
,
her
fall
in
love
with
tom
,
etc.
-rrb-
,
sometim
move
on
too
quickli
for
it
own
good
.

some
place
the
plot
just
doe
n't
make
sens
,
sometim
it
's
wai
too
contriv
-lrb-
the
crab
bit
,
for
exampl
-rrb-
,
and
sometim
too
corni
-lrb-
peach
emit
dry
ic
.

ca
n't
beat
that
-rrb-
.

all
in
all
the
plot
seem
fragment
,
unconnect
.

not
romant
at
all
,
and
onli
funni
in
some
place
.

so
,
okai
,
do
the
magic
power
come
from
the
crab
?

or
the
fairi
godfath
?

she
can
float
now
too
?

and
all
of
a
sudden
,
instead
of
just
make
dry
ic
come
out
of
peach
,
she
can
put
her
emot
into
her
food
?

tom
all
of
a
sudden
just
accept
amanda
's
``
witchcraft
''
in
the
end
?

would
peopl
realli
dine
in
a
restaur
that
resembl
life
after
death
in
tupac
's
video
?

what
the
hell
is
up
with
that
damn
crab
?

it
is
unfortun
,
becaus
i
like
the
basic
premis
of
the
movi
,
until
it
becam
too
fantast
and
tiresom
.

the
film
seem
to
skirt
around
a
seriou
theme
or
at
least
a
theme
for
a
while
,
but
toward
the
end
it
resolv
to
show
us
long
flashback
clip
andminut
of
peopl
cry
at
their
tabl
.

the
humor
wa
good
in
some
place
-lrb-
nolan
get
the
funniest
bit
,
includ
that
incomprehens
,
total
random
thing
with
the
doll
-rrb-
.

gellar
and
flanneri
ar
qualifi
actor
,
and
gellar
ha
a
particular
charm
,
but
i
much
prefer
her
plai
the
sauci
buffi
-lrb-
or
even
annett
in
the
upcom
``
cruel
intent
''
-rrb-
than
thi
sorri
excus
for
a
charact
.

it
's
almost
funni
sometim
to
see
these
two
try
so
hard
to
make
the
dialogu
sound
better
than
it
is
,
or
try
to
make
the
relationship
seem
more
plausibl
.

the
support
charact
nolan
wa
a
highlight
,
though
he
remind
me
a
bit
of
kevin
in
``
you
've
got
mail
''
-lrb-
see
footnot
-rrb-
.

and
,
as
alwai
,
typic
of
a
chick
flick
/
romant
comedi
,
there
's
a
seemingli
endless
romant
soundtrack
in
the
background
,
cu
up
at
all
the
right
place
.

thi
sort
of
got
on
the
nerv
after
a
while
,
too
.

``
simpli
irresist
''
is
not
hard
to
understand
,
light
,
funni
in
some
place
,
and
gener
disappoint
becaus
it
ca
n't
draw
the
line
between
romanc
and
protract
sap
,
between
humor
and
tire
slapstick
.

and
how
could
i
refrain
from
make
a
pun
?

...
``
simpli
irresist
''
is
all
too
easi
to
resist
.

did
anyon
els
think
thi
wa
a
tad
bit
similar
to
``
you
've
got
mail
''
-lrb-
or
``
the
shop
around
the
corner
''
-rrb-
?

busi
rival
fall
in
love
.

femal
counterpart
's
busi
is
in
danger
of
be
shut
down
.

femal
as
mother-like
figur
guid
her

the
