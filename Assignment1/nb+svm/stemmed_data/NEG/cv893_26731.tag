i
went
to
blair
witch
project
2
:
book
of
shadow
with
the
highest
of
hope
.

the
origin
film
,
releas
last
summer
,
wa
genuin
scari
and
terrifi
;
i
hope
that
thi
movi
would
live
up
to
it
predecessor
.

unfortun
,
my
hope
were
soon
dash
.

as
the
movi
open
,
the
audienc
is
shown
pseudo-documentari
clip
of
burkittsvil
,
maryland
resid
be
interview
about
the
sudden
tourist
influx
to
their
town
as
a
result
of
the
origin
blair
witch
project
movi
.

it
's
a
mostli
humor
,
self-awar
poke
at
the
media
hype
and
hysteria
surround
the
first
film
.

dure
thi
segment
,
we
ar
introduc
to
the
protagonist
,
a
young
man
who
sell
blair
witch-relat
memorabilia
from
hi
websit
.

the
movi
then
cut
to
a
titl
that
inform
us
that
what
we
ar
about
to
see
occur
on
year
previous
.

we
see
the
same
young
man
that
wa
sell
blair
witch
paraphernalia
,
but
now
he
is
confin
in
a
mental
institut
the
sort
of
which
on
onli
find
in
bad
horror
movi
.

we
see
him
have
some
sort
of
disgust
white
goo
unconvincingli
forc
down
hi
nose
while
a
cigarett-smoke
doctor
luridli
leer
abov
him
.

we
see
him
throw
himself
wildli
around
a
pad
room
;
we
see
him
cower
nake
in
a
shower
stall
as
a
fire
hose
is
turn
on
him
.

no
explan
is
provid
for
why
he
is
in
the
mental
institut
;
in
fact
,
these
scene
ar
bare
refer
to
again
.

i
had
a
sink
feel
dure
these
open
scene
;
gener
,
a
hospit
scene
that
is
set
with
poor
light
,
filthi
interior
,
and
evil
doctor
is
a
sure
sign
that
you
ar
in
the
throe
of
a
truli
horribl
movi
.

the
movi
cut
again
,
thi
time
to
the
present
.

the
young
man
,
whose
name
is
jeffrei
-lrb-
plai
by
jeffrei
donovan
--
as
in
the
first
movi
,
the
charact
name
ar
ident
to
the
actor
'
name
,
although
thi
movi
admit
up
front
that
it
is
fiction
,
so
there
's
no
reason
for
the
practic
thi
time
around
-rrb-
,
is
round
up
a
group
of
peopl
that
he
will
be
lead
into
the
wood
that
weekend
for
the
``
blair
witch
hunt
,
''
which
is
a
promot
gimmick
he
came
up
with
and
sell
on

websit
.

we
meet
tristen
and
steven
,
a
young
coupl
who
ar
write
a
book
about
the
blair
witch
experi
.

steven
is
a
skeptic
,
believ
the
whole
thing
to
be
the
result
of
mass
hysteria
.

tristen
,
on
the
other
hand
,
believ
that
there
mai
be
some
truth
to
the
rumor
of
supernatur
occurr
.

she
is
wan
and
soft-spoken
;
she
complain
that
the
radio

-lrb-
she
also
complain
that
she
feel
nauseat
;
i
knew
immedi

-rrb-

thi
movi
wa
aw
.

simpli
aw
.

the
charact
ar
broadli-drawn
caricatur
that
ar
never
allow
ani
depth
or
develop
.

erica
is
the
natur-love
wiccan
.

tristen
is
the
weak
and
sympathet
woman
.

steven
is
the
overbear
asshol
.

kim
is
the
antisoci
goth
girl
.

old
,
tire
clich
were
us
to
illustr
these
caricatur
.

how
do
we
know
tristen
is
weak
and
sympathet
?

becaus
she
's
pregnant
!

how
do
we
know
kim
is
an
antisoci
goth
girl
?

becaus
she
wear
a
lot
of
ey
makeup
!

how
do
we
know
the
local
sheriff
is
a
bad
gui
?

becaus
he
ha
jag
teeth
and
talk
like
he
's
straight
out
of
``
deliver
''
!

thi
is
weak
storytel
at
it
worst
.

rather
than
take
the
time
to
flesh
out
the
charact
and
make
them
truli
sympathet
,
the
writer
chose
to
give
each
on
a
few
stereotyp
characterist
,
in
an
attempt
to
us
some
cinemat
shorthand
and
therebi
skip
straight
to
the
action
.

it
did
n't
work
.

on
top
of
be
poorli
develop
,
most
of
the
charact
were
either
serious
unlik
or
patent
stupid
.

-lrb-
``
honei
,
you
just
had
a
miscarriag
out
in
the
wood
and
got
medic
attent
at
a

that
look
like
it

in
a
bad
slasher
movi

``
ok

-rrb-

frankli
,
by
the
end
of
the
movi
,
i
wa
root
for
the
witch
.

i
also
felt
that
there
wa
simpli
too
much
blood
'n'
gore
in
thi
film
.

the
first
movi
work
by
never
show
us
the
horror
.

the
witch
wa
a
palpabl
presenc
in
that
movi
,
but
we
never
saw
it
;
we
never
saw
anyth
,
in
fact
.

the
horror
wa
all
off-screen
,
and
thu
our
imagin
work
overtim
to
envis
what
it
might
possibl
be
.

thi
is
the
hallmark
of
a
truli
creepi
and
disturb
horror
movi
.

blair
witchdispens
with
such
niceti
and
went
straight
for
the
gross-out
.

thi
wa
evid
from
the
open
scene
of
the
mad
doctor
forc
white
goo
down
jeffrei
's
throat
,
and
continu
throughout
the
film
as
the
audienc
is
treat
to
occasion
confus
and
disori
footag
of
what
appear
to
be
a
ritual
massacr
of
some
sort
.

knive
plung
into
flesh
,
bloodi
finger
trail
off
into
the
dark
,
and
none
of
it
is
explain
until
the
veri
end
,
when
it
wa
too
late
for
me
to
care
.

thi
movi
did
n't
stop
with
show
us
the
gore
,
either
;
it
went
for
broke
and
show
us
everyth
.

by
the
end
of
the
movi
,
there
ar
no
question
remain
about
the
miss
five
hour
.

it
is
all
explain
;
in
fact
,
it
is
all
shown
on-screen
in
love
detail
.

i
confess
to
be
someon
who
prefer
horror
movi
in
which
you
never
see
the
monster
,
or
see
onli
brief
glimps
,
mere
suggest
of
what
the
monster
is
;
it
is
not
becaus
i
find
the
monster
so
terrifi
,
but
becaus
i
find
the
absenc
of
the
monster
to
be
infinit
more
terrifi
.

i
have
seen
interview
with
the
director
in
which
he
suggest
that
there
is
no
``
monster
,
''
that
all
of
the
evil
wa
perpetr
onli
by
the
human
mind
.

i
found
thi
to
be
a
miser
poor
explan
;
if
it
wa
in
fact
the
director
's
intent
,
then
he
need
to
have
some
word
with
the
writer
,
becaus
it
wa
not
made
clear
at
all
.

-lrb-
i
know
a
lot
of
peopl
who
like
to
go
to
parti
and
get
drunk
and
stone
out
of
their
mind
;
none
of
them
ha
ever
gone
on
a
murder
rampag
and
then
experienc
mass
hallucin
with
a
group
of
other
peopl
for
the
next
week
or
so
.

and
if
there
wa
no
witch
,
then
what
about
the
vanish
tree
?

the
snowfal
of
manuscript
paper
?

hm
?
-rrb-

blair
witch
2
:
book
of
shadow
wa
a
horribl
movi
.

from
the
poorli-written
charact
to
the
implaus
stori
to
the
plot
inconsist
to
the
gross-out
shot
,
it
wa
a
bad

and
