spade
ha
a
snide
,
sarcast
sens
of
humor
that
work
perfectli
on
the
tv
sitcom
just
shoot
me
.

it
also
serv
as
a
good
showcas
for
him
when
he
co-star
,
opposit
the
late
chri
farlei
,
in
tommi
boi
and
black
sheep
.

lost
and
found
mark
the
comedian
's
first
attempt
at
go
solo
in
a
movi
,
and
it
also
reveal
that
when
spade
doe
n't
have
a
reliabl
back-up
system
,
hi
brand
of
humor
seem
more
desper
than
on
mai
expect
.

david
spade
is
not
the
problem
with
lost
and
found
.

he
plai
dylan
ramsei
,
the
sweet
main
charact
,
to
the
best
of
hi
abil
.

the
stori
revolv
around
dylan
's
obsess
with
hi
beauti
new
neighbour
,
lila
duboi
-lrb-
sophi
marceau
,
from
braveheart
-rrb-
,
and
her
terrier
name
jack
.

dylan
believ
that
the
best
wai
to
a
woman
's
heart
is
through
her
dog
.

and
so
he
kidnap
jack
,
plan
to
stage
a
fake
rescu
,
in
hope
to
win
lila
over
.

there
ar
three
good
thing
about
lost
and
found
.

the
first
is
spade
.

the
second
is
sophi
marceau
,
a
love
actress
who
's
been
plant
into
the
wrong
movi
.

lastli
,
there
's
the
dog
,
who
is
us
here
in
a
similar
context
to
puffi
from
there
's
someth
about
mari
.

unfortun
,
director
jeff
pollack
find
more
humor
in
put
jack
through
a
cycl
in
the
drier
than
he
doe
with
simpli
make
him
look
cute
.

thi
kind
of
physic
humor
is
dead
.

pollack
doe
everyth
but
beat
the
poor
pooch
with
a
basebal
bat
to
get
laugh
,
and
thi
procedur
is
cheap
,
unfunni
and
resoundingli
cruel
.

thi
is
where
i
start
to
get
fuzzi
.

also
in
thi
unusu
blend
is
-lrb-
appar
-rrb-
a
sweet-natur
love
stori
between
dylan
and
lila
.

given
the
mean-spirit
comedi
that
the
movi
is
obvious
strive
for
,
i
found
thi
hard
to
swallow
.

and
,
why
doe
dylan
even
deserv
someon
like
lila
,
after
kidnap
her
preciou
dog
and
put
it
through
such
pain
?

predict
,
lost
and
found
opt
for
a
happi
end
,
on
that
feel
so
sentiment
,
gooei
,
and
ring
so
fals
that
it
set
off
a
siren
in
your
head
that
make
you
feel
a
bit
cheat
.
