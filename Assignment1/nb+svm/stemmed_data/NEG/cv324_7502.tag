i
wish
more
film
would
take
on
issu
of
faith
and
moral
in
the
modern
world
.

and
i
wish
that
film-maker
would
us
command
as
a
blueprint
on
how
_
not
_
to
do
it
.

writer/director
daniel
taplitz
ha
creat
a
bizarr
conglomer
of
satir
and
soul-search
in
thi
tale
of
seth
warner
-lrb-
aidan
quinn
-rrb-
,
a
man
of
faith
who
run
into
a
streak
of
bad
luck
which
usual
inspir
countri-western
lyric
:
hi
pregnant
wife
drown
,
hi
home
is
destroi
by
a
tornado
,
he
lose
hi
job
and
hi
dog
is
crippl
by
a
bolt
of
lightn
.

convinc
that
god
ha
broken
hi
half
of
the
coven
,
seth
decid
to
break
hi
,
and
set
out
to
turn
everi
``
thou
shalt
not
''
of
the
ten
command
into
a
``
thou
shalt
''
-lrb-
and
vice
versa
-rrb-
.

hi
wife
's
sister
rachel
-lrb-
``
friend
''
'
courtenei
cox
-rrb-
want
to
help
seth
;
rachel
's
selfish
husband
harri
-lrb-
anthoni
lapaglia
-rrb-
,
who
tend
to
break
a
few
command
of
hi
own
,
think
seth
is
a
lunat
.

thu
begin
a
film
which
pick
the
wrong
tone
for
everi
occas
.

taplitz
is
n't
interest
in
treat
seth
's
tragedi
as
genuin
tragic
,
make
it
imposs
to
sympath
with
him
.

compos
joseph
vitarelli
provid
a
score
full
of
whimsic
woodwind
,
turn
seth
's
sacrilegi
mission
into
an
amus
lark
;
quinn
's
perform
as
seth
is
all
wild-ei
fervor
without
ani
genuin
pain
.

the
actual
break
of
the
command
is
almost
treat
as
an
afterthought
,
with
on
through
five
dispatch
in
a
five-minut
montag
.

the
result
is
a
charact
whose
action
feel
less
like
the
authent
respons
of
an
anguish
man
than
the
machin
of
a
high-concept
movi
plot
.

it
's
not
even
entir
clear
that
command
is
about
seth
.

corpor
attornei
rachel
is
given
a
case
which
is
suppos
to
soften
a
hard
heart
we
see
no
indic
she
ha
,
while
harri
get
hi
comeupp
as
part
of
seth
's
``
fals
wit
.
''

onli
courtenei
cox
strike
a
note
of
realiti
in
a
solid
perform
;
she
is
sane
center
around
which
too
equal
troubl
men
revolv
.

even
she
ca
n't
forc
taplitz
to
decid
whose
stori
thi
is
,
or
what
we
should
have
learn
about
deal
with
the
struggl
in
our
live
and
our
relationship
with
the
infinit
.

by
the
time
seth
make
a
singularli
biblic
reappear
late
in
the
film
,
it
ha
becom
clear
that
taplitz
is
aim
for
a
fantast
fabl
which
make
no
connect
with
real
human
experi
.

command
is
a
bad
comedi
which
could
have
been
a
decent
drama
if
daniel
taplitz
had
had
the
gut
to
take
faith
--
and
the
loss
thereof
--
at
all
serious
.
