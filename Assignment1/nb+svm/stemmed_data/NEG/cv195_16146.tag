blue
is
inspir
and
the
whole

there
's
a
chanc
for
some
smart
satir
on

obsess
but
the
humor
here
is
decidedli
lowbrow
.

van
der
beek
doe
a
decent
job
of
carri
hi
first
film
although
a
silli

trip
him
up
sometim
.

also
,
the
role
is
n't
veri
much
of
a
stretch
from
hi
dawson
leari
charact
.

he
's
still
a
pseudo-intellectu
,
whini
,
nice
gui
,
except
here
he
also
happen
to
be
a
jock
.

voight
is
a
terror
as
he
chew
up
everi
singl
piec
of
sceneri
and
spit
it
out
.

the
other
adult
ar
all
notabl
aw
while
the
younger
perform
do
n't
fare
much
better
.

on
the
posit
side
,

is
a

actor
who
is
due
for
a
breakout

and
hi

includ
a

''

it
's
interest
to
note
that
the
film
definit
earn
it

here
a
bit
but
still
fail
to
make
much
of
an

the
look
of
the
movi
is
as
bland
as
the

.

the

there

it
