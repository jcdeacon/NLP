even

the
fault

in

and

while
set
up
a
stori
about
misus
of
power
,
about
the
true
possessor
of
that
power
,
and
about
intrigu
and
doubl-cross
,
it
doe
not
resolv
it
.

not
on
buildup
of
suspens
is
resolv
by
an
excit
climax
.

rather
,
the
tens
situat
ar
left
dangl
at
the
end
,
give
the
viewer
an
uneasi
sens
of
incomplet
.

an
exampl
of
thi
is
a
veri
promis
and
tens
buildup
of
a
scene
:
in
an
attempt
to
arrest
clint
eastwood
,
the
polic
have
set
up
a
trap
at
a
small
restaur
.

polic
offic
ar
everywher
,
incognito
of
cours
.

at
the
same
time
,
not
on
but
two
hit
men
ar
prepar
to
kill
clint
eastwood
when
he
arriv
.

all
three
parti
ar
unawar
of
each
other
presenc
.

thi
scene
is
tremend
excit
and
the
audienc
is
wonder
how
clint
eastwood
,
who
might
suspect
thi
is
a
trap
,
will
get
himself
out
of
thi
difficult
posit
.

he
will
probabl
have
a
brilliant
plan
,
involv
ingeni
prepar
.

howev
,
when
he
arriv
at
the
trap
,
both
hit
men
miss
-lrb-
how
conveni
-rrb-
and
in
the
confus
eastwood
simpli
walk
awai
.

the
buildup
of
thi
scene
took
about
ten
minut
.

ten
minut
of
close
up
of
the
hit
men
load
their
weapon
intercut
with
the
polic
prepar
for
the
trap
.

the
scene
wa
resolv
in
less
than
20
second
...
parallel
to
the
stori
line
of
catch
the
real
killer
is
a
clich
emot
tale
about
the
estrang
relationship
between
father
eastwood
and
hi
daughter
.

the
daughter
blame
her
father
for
never
be
there
for
her
,
becaus
he
wa
either
in
jail
or
rob
a
hous
somewher
.

of
cours
their
relationship
take
a
turn
for
the
better
dure
the
adventur
and
thei
end
up
a
happi
famili
.

again
,
it
is
commend
that
absolut
power
tri
to
deviat
from
the
mainstream
suspens
film
by
give
room
for
a
dramat
subplot
.

howev
,
try
is
simpli
not
enough
!

the
second
stori
line
should
be
subtl
,
origin
and
prefer
unpredict
...
everyth
thi
film
is
not
.

how
could
a
screenplai
like
absolut
power
ever
get
the
fund
to
be
produc
?

how
could
eastwood
,
who
ha
successfulli
produc
and
direct
mani
outstand
film
such
as
the
brilliant
unforgiven
,
ever
believ
in
a
project
like
thi
on
?

i
am
sad
to
sai
that
my
respect
for
the
actor/director/produc
ha
diminish
substanti
due
to
thi
film
.

director
quentin
tarantino
onc
said
:
``
i
can
make
a
good
movi
out
of
ani
bad
script
.
''

director
clint
eastwood
obvious
can
not
.
