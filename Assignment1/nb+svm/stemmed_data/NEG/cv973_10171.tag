in
the
continu
of
warner
brother
's
franchis
,
joel
schumach
ha
successfulli
kill
thi
cash
cow
.

what
make
thi
film
such
a
grand
disappoint
is
the
tremend
line
up
of
talent
peopl
involv
with
the
film
.

avika
goldsman
's
screenplai
is
such
a
clutter
mess
that
there
is
no
suspens
built
from
on
scene
to
anoth
.

thi
come
on
the
heal
of
such
a
marvel
written
project
as
``
the
client
''
is
such
a
shock
that
it
give
rise
to
thought
that
the
latter
film
wa
a
fluke
.

situat
ar
develop
and
execut
with
no
thought
of
reason
other
that
to
get
the
charact
from
on
point
to
anoth
.

thi
is
most
glaringli
brought
to
point
by
the
appear
of
alicia
silverston
's
batgirl
,
who
just
happen
to
be
alfr
's
niec
.

the
stori
of
dr.
victor
freez
is
told
almost
complet
in
dialogu
as
an
afterthought
.

while
work
on
a
cure
for
a
tragic
deceas
contract
by
hi
wife
,
dr.
freez
is
injur
dure
a
cryogen
procedur
,
and
becom
a
man
who
can
onli
surviv
in
a
sub
zero
environ
.

now
of
cours
he
ha
becom
a
terrorist
intent
on
turn
the
world
into
a
frozen
planet
where
onli
he
can
live
.

now
the
logic
of
that
littl
sub-plot
escap
me
.

if
mr.
freez
want
to
find
a
cure
for
hi
wife
and
bring
her
back
from
the
brink
of
death
,
why
would
he
want
to
have
her
live
in
a
world
with
no
warmth
.

thi
is
inde
a
cold
heart
man
.

the
develop
of
poison
ivi
is
no
less
contradictori
.

she
want
to
breed
a
form
of
plant
life
that
can
defend
itself
like
an
anim
.

she
join
with
mr.
freez
in
hi
plan
to
start
a
new
ic
ag
,
destroi
all
anim
life
,
therefor
give
her
plant
creation
no
reason
to
have
the
defens
mechan
she
had
been
try
to
breed
into
them
.

the
charact
have
no
logic
.

batman
of
cours
is
no
longer
the
dark
knight
of
the
earlier
film
.

now
that
he
ha
an
adopt
son
in
burt
ward
/
robin
,
bruce
wayn
is
try
to
be
a
father
figur

while

time

georg
cloonei
tri
in
vain
to
keep
from
roll
hi
ey
while
recit
the
dialogu
given
him
.

to
sai
that
hi
perform
is
workman-like
is
to
be
gener
.

hi
best
perform
ar
still
on
``

.

bruce
wayn
ha
the
most
unromant
even
with
hi
girlfriend
-lrb-
plai
by
ell
macpherson
-rrb-
,
that
it
bring
into
question
bruce
's
latent
homosexu
.

there
is
no
spark
and
no
passion
-lrb-
as
there
wa
for
nicol
kidman
's
psychologist
in
``
batman
forev
''
-rrb-
between
bruce
and
anyon
other
than
alfr
.

and
even
that
relationship
is
veri
reserv
.

robin
come
off
less
charismat
that
in
the
last
film
in
the
seri
.

now
he
's
just
a
spoil
kid
.

in
``
batman
forev
''
,
burt
ward
want
to
be
batman
's
partner
and
friend
.

now
,
robin
is
suffer
from
ego
defici
.

robin
's
attract
for
poison
ivi
is
not
believ
,
except
for
a

around
the

of

hi
robin
need
noth
more
than
a
good
spank
.

the
less
said
about
alicia
silverston
's
perform
the
better
.

thi
talent
young
actress
read
her
line
with
all
the
aplomb
of
a
dub
actor
for
a
godzilla
film
.

she
wa
cast
strictli
for
her
commerci
valu
and
she
knew
it
.

thi
bring
us
to
the
villain
.

arnold
scharzenegg
walk
through
hi
part
with
all
the
concern
of
someon
wait
for
paydai
.

the
most
redicul
scene
is
dure
mr.
freez
's
imprison
.

the
guard
ar
at
least
a
foot
taller
that
arnold
and
yet
fall
at
hi
hand
in
on
of
the
most
unbeliev
fight
scene
caught
on
film
.

it
's
almost
as
ludicr
as
see
michael
jackson
as
a
gang
member
.

umu
thurman
strut
and
coo
her

ha
all
the
come
hither
sex
appeal
of
mai
west
in
``

-rrb-
.

the
onli
perform
worthi
of
notic
ar
pat
hingl
and
michael
gough
.

these
two
season
veteran
carri
their
scene
with
a
digniti
sore
lack
from
the
rest
of
the
film
.

without
go
through
the
intricaci
of
the
plot
,
there
is
on
question
that
alwai
come
to
mind
with
thi
seri
-lrb-
except
for
the
first
``
batman
''
-rrb-
,
and
that
is
how
do
these
super
villain
manag
to
hire
so
mani
thug
onli
to
abandon
them
at
the
final
reel
.

mr.

is
introduc
with
a
team
of
hockei
plai
hoodlum
that
seem
to
have
step
out
of
an

everi

have
to
have
a

,
no
on
can
be
an
individu
with
dai
glow
paint
on
their
face
or
some
sort
of
elabor
costum
.

with
thi
film
,
warner
brother
ha
succeed
in
retrograd
the
seri
back
to
it
's
tv
incarn
.

the
onli
thing
miss
from
the

ar
the
superimpos
titl
detail
the
pow
!

,
gwaaaa
's
,
and
clang
's
associ

.

you
almost
wonder
if
william
dozier
,
produc
of
the
tv
seri
is
collect
royalti
from
thi
film
.

the
special
effect
-lrb-
by
john
dykstra
-rrb-
and
product
design
-lrb-
by
barbara
ling
-rrb-
ar
the
primari
star
of
thi
film
.

and
it
is
a
case
of
extravag
in
the
pursuit
of
noth
.

everi
set
,
from
ivi
's
lair
,
the
batcav
,
to
freez
's
hideout
is
set
with
enough
neon
and
fiberglass
to
keep
the
epa
in
paperwork
for

to
come
.

there
is
no
on
realist
set
or

everyth
is
set
for

.

the
special

have
that
strang

there
ar

hi
work
on
``

-lrb-
the

-rrb-
but
these
scene
ar
so
wroth
with
glare
color
and

that
thei
ar
almost
obscur
.

joel

mr.

but
``
