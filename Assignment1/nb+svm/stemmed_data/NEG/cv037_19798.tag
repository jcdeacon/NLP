discov

a

who
worship

along

,
a

who
live
out
on

you
know
what
to
expect
from
thi
movi
:
lot
of
shot

the

hector

's
obsess

and
stupidli
endang
the

charact
who
insist
that
the

n't
possibl
exist
.

unlik
it
slipperi
cousin
``

,
''
``
lake
placid
''
want
to
present
it
formula
plot
tongu-in-cheek
,
which
is
self-defeat
.

the
result
is
neither
scari
nor
funni
;
it
's
just
tediou
.

-rrb-
doe
n't
seem
to
have
the
stomach
for
a
chomp
'em
up
flick
.

the
bodi
count
is
surprisingli
low
and
doe
n't
includ
ani
of
the
major
charact
,
and
most
annoyingli
kelli
and
hector
insist
that
thei
captur
the
crocodil
aliv
rather
than
kill
it
.

-lrb-
``

manag
to
have
it
both
wai-i
'll
let
you
discov
how
for
yourself
-rrb-
.

the
croc
itself
is
mostli
comput-gener
,
of
cours
.

like
the
snake
in
``
anaconda
,
''
the
thirti-foot
monster
crocodil
doe
n't
seem
real
;
it
move
too
quickli
and
in
wai
that
seem
unnatur
.

``
lake
placid
''
also
offer
littl
explan
for
why
a
giant
crocodil
is
in
main
.

there
is
a
lot
of
semi-mystic
mumbo
jumbo
about
how
``
we
realli
do
n't
know
much
about
crocodil
.
''

thei
would
have
been
better
off
go
with
someth
like
the
urban
myth
about
allig
in
the
sewer
.

a
movi
like
thi
doe
n't
have
to
offer
much
of
an
explan
-lrb-
radioact
mutant
?

creatur
from
outer
space
?
-rrb-

,
but
it
doe
have
to
give
the
audienc
someth
to
hang
their
disbelief
on
.

pullman
and
fonda
seem
to
be
plod
through
the
movi
on
auto-pilot
.

most
of
the
time
,
thei
're
probabl
think
about
kill
their
agent
or
wonder
if
make
thi
movi
mark
the
end
of
their
career
.

platt
and
white
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seem
to
be
give
their
best
effort
,
and
thei
manag
to
squeez
a

of
thi
sorri
