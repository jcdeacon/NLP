the
joke
ar
right
out
of
``

there
's

i
yell
back
at
the

,
``
so
did
these

''

i
watch
thi
movi
with
the
whole
famili
and
everyon
hate
it

my

wa
so
bore
she
brought
out
the
coupon
book
midwai
through

,
around
the
start
of
the
second

,
i
start
write
my

the
blame
ca
n't
realli
be
place
on
the
star
,
though
.

kelsei
grammer
is
good
in
thi

he
just
doe

hi

is
said
to
have
gotten
so
drunk
on

that
he
had
``

,
who
is
likeabl
in

just
becaus
she
's
so
gorgeou

as
for
schneider
-lrb-
whose
charact
is
downright
annoi
-rrb-
,
there
wa
nowher
to
go

up
after

,
although
he
's
still
in
the
depth
of
the
comedi
ocean
after
jump
the
``

ship
.

my
theori
is
that
down

is
on
of
those
movi
that
got
the
green
light
befor
the
script
wa
even
written
as
