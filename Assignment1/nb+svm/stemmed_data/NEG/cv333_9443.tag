stori
about
conscienc-stricken
lawyer
take
an
abrupt
detour
as
supernatur
forc
begin
to
tinker
with
the
stori
.

it
begin
like
a
typic
parabl
where
a
small-town
boi
make
it
big
,
but
then
ha
to
balanc
hi
sens
of
self
against
the
allur
of
monei
,
power
,
and
greed
.

but
milton
is
far
more
than
just
a
corrupt
partner
of
the
firm
.

quit
liter
,
he
is
the
devil
in
disguis
,
and
as
the
movi
progress
,
he
reveal
some
uncanni
talent
that
on
could
have
onli
if
he
had
sold
hi
soul
long
ago
.

freaki
and
frighten
thing
begin
to
happen
,
and
after
much
of
the
film
ha
elasp
,
milton
's
horrifi
intent
is
final
reveal
.

the
movi
tri
to
give
us
two
separ
and
distinct
act
.

the
first
involv
the
comeupp
of
lomax
as
a
big-citi
trial
lawyer
.

the
second
focus
on
milton
and
hi
ulterior
motiv
for
emploi
lomax
.

unfortun
,
the
two
never
mix
well
into
a
cohes
stori
,
and
what
we
get
ar
two
underdevelop
stori
that
reli
too
much
on
on
shaki
revel
to
tie
them
togeth
and
an
impress
product
piec
to
give
it
an
underli
atmospher
.

grant
,
the
film
is
veri
handsom-look
.

you
'll
enjoi
the
final
scene
where
the
wall
mural
seemingli
come
to
life
dure
a
heat
speech
given
by
pacino
.

you
'll
also
like
the
imag
of
power
and
temptat
express
through
the
fleshi
and
flashi
parti
.

you
'll
also
feel
the
loneli
and
insan
that
set
in
with
mari
ann
,
know
that
her
husband
is
slowli
drift
awai
.

thi
wa
on
of
the
better
storylin
,
but
unfortun
,
is
onli
a
sub-plot
.

as
with
all
thing
's
involv
the
devil
,
you
can
expect
noth
but
the
worst
.

in
the
first
few
scene
,
reev
anchor
the
film
,
but
then
slowli
drift
into
the
background
.

hi
path
from
self-vaniti
to
self-conscious
is
never
fulli
explor
.

hi
action
seem
arbitrari
,
and
hi
reason
for
them
not
fulli
known
.

pacino
's
comic
portray
is
spirit
,
but
the
vaniti
of
hi
charact
begin
to
shift
the
focu
of
the
movi
.

there
is
anoth
plot
or
two
that
is
introduc
,
but
never
get
revisit
.

the
focu
seem
inconsist
throughout
,
and
the
final
payoff
seem
quick
and
cheap
.

thi
movi
tri
to
be
horrifi
,
thrill
,
and
dramat
all
at
the
same
time
.

howev
,
while
the
devil
's
advoc
strive
to
get
notic
,
ultim
it
make
veri
littl
impress
at
all
.
