so
mani

that
it
must
be
hard

thi

in

i

by
how
mani
similar
there
wa
between
thi
film
and
,
arguabl

the
best
gangster

of

if
you
ar
go

not

,
why
not
borrow
from

the

in

is
done
rather
well

i
enjoi
the
portray
of
the
network
of
``
runner
''
sprint
through
the
street
collect
bet
for
the
queen
lotteri
.

thi
wa
the
wai
of
life
in
harlem

and
most
peopl
involv
with
the
queen
did
so
becaus
it

the

put

number

wa
the
onli

i
also
enjoi
the
interact

the
angri
,
violent
dutch
and
the
calm
,
patient
lucki
.

after
about
the
30-40
minut
mark
all
of
the
similar
with
the
godfath
start
appear
,
on
after
the
other
-lrb-

in

it
wa
a
huge
distract
,
and
an
insult
to
my
intellig

who
wa
the

here
?

some

done
