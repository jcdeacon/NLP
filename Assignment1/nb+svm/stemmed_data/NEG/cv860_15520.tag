i
guess
that
if
a
veri
wild
bachelor
parti
had
gone
realli
bad
,
there
would
be
broken
furnitur
,
trace
of
smack
and
cocain
on
the
floor
,
and
a
dead
prostitut
in
the
bathroom
.

i
guess
that
if
a
movi
had
also
gone
realli
bad
,
there
might
be
the
same
element
present
.

coincid

that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
buri

where
she
'll

although

which
also
disturbingli
involv

but
the
burden
of

begin
to
affect

as
well
.

boyd
is
the

of

seemingli
suffer
from
a
long
psychosi
,
when
he
feel
as

he

then
,
there
's
moor
-lrb-
leland
orser
-rrb-
who
speakslin
and
walk
around
with
a
puzzl
look
on
hi
face
.

the
problem
with
thi
reprehens
movi
is
that
it
want
to
be
a
cruel
comedi
,
but
it
present
thing
in
a
manner
that
just
ar
n't
funni
.

drug
,
mutil
,
and
kill
your
own
friend
is
n't
someth
to
be
laugh
at
.

as
a
straight
psycholog
drama
,
i
could
see
how
it
might
have
work
,
as
each
on
tri
to
maneuv
and
overcom
the
weight
of
their
own
guilt
in
their
own
sometim-sick
wai
.

but
thi
movi
insult
us
by
assum
that
we
could
simpli
discard
our
valu
forhour
.

if
you
do
like
thi
movi
,
i
do
n't
think
that
i
want
to
know
you
.

i
did
find
slater
a
convinc
leader
who
swai
hi
friend
to
choos
not
the
right
thing
but
the
smart
plai
.
'

and
diaz
add
some
bright
to
thi
film
as
a
wed-need
fiance
.

but
her
talent
ar
essenti
wast
here
.

it
's
obviou
that
the
film
maker
is
try
to
strike
a
certain
tone
.

but
the
wai
that
he
choos
to
do
it
is
tasteless
.

do
not
make
a
veri
bad
decis
by
see
thi
film
.
