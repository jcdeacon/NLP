it
's
all

of
some
type
of

but
all
i
rememb
is
--
and
i
kid
you

graphic

a

bomb

and
an
hat-wear
figur
on
the
other
side
of

world
burst
out
into
laughter
...
.

which
is
what
the
crowd
at
the
show
i
attend
spontan
did
throughout
_
knock_off
_
.

while
all
of
van
damm
's
film
have
it
share
of
unintent
laugh
,
mostli
due
to
the
stiff
act
``
skill

of

a
lot
of
the
laugh
ar
earn
by
some
particularli
pain
line
by

:
``

and
``

''

stand
out
among
my
favorit
.

but
it
is
inde
the
pathet
perform
that
provid
the
bulk
of
_
knock_off
_
's
laugh
.

van
damm
is
true
to
laughabl
form
,
perhap
even
wors
than
usual
.

-rrb-
,
and
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
still-heavili-accent
van
damm
haplessli
try
to
drop
punchlin
is
hilari
in
the
wrong
wai
.

even
typic
good
actor
ar
not
immun
to
the
bad
act
bug
.

paul
sorvino
is
unconvinc
and
terribl
overwrought
as
schneider
's
cia
superior
;
and
lela
rochon
,
plai
an
investig
for
the
jean
compani
,
spend
the
entir
movi
in
perpetu
snarl
mode
.

in
rochon
's
defens
,
though
,
her
role
requir
her
to
do
littl
more
than
displai
her
tone
leg
,
exquisit
bone
structur
,
and
perki
bosom
,
the
latter
come
in
handi
for
on
kei
scene
where
she
must
fish
for
microbomb
stuck
in
her
ampl
cleavag
.

tsui
pick
up
where
he
left
off
visual
in
_
doubl_team
_
,
juic
up
the
proceed
with
invent
camera
work
.

here
,
though
,
tsui
's
visual
razzl
dazzl
border
on
over
kill
,
come
off
as
desper
attempt
to
shield
the
inan
of
the
entir
enterpris
.

for
each
nifti
trick
tsui
pull
off
,
such
as
a
recur
visual
theme
that
ha
the
camera
liter
go
through
the
circuitri
of
electron
devic
,
there
ar
other
that
ar
complet
superflu
.

thi
is
especi
disconcert
when
the
trick
in
question
could
be
clever
when
us
in
the
right
context
.

for
instanc
,
on
scene
earli
on
ha
marcu
put
hi
hand
in
a
box
.

as
he
put
hi
hand
in
,
the
same
action
is
shown
from
an
overhead
camera
angl
in
a
rectangl
at
the
corner
of
the
screen
.

it
's
undoubtedli
an
interest
visual
,
but
it
would
have
been
nice
if
it
us
actual
amount
to
someth
.

the
test
of
a
van
damm
movi
boil
down
to
the
action
sequenc
,
but
surprisingli
,
those
in
_
knock_off
_
leav
much
to
be
desir
.

tsui
doe
what
he
can
to
make
someth
of
them
,
emploi
freez
frame
,
blur
motion
,
and
unconvent
camera
angl
,
but
there
is
noth
fundament
special
about
the
fairli
gener
chase
and
fight
sequenc
written
by
desouza
.

there
is
n't
anyth
as
preposter
amus
as
the
climact
tiger/land
mine
fight
in
_
doubl_team
_
,
let
alon
anyth
remot
close
to
tsui
's
legendari
hong
kong
work
-lrb-
but
that
's
a
given
go
in
-rrb-
.

if
tsui
ha
ani
hope
of
approach
hi
countryman
john
woo
's
statesid
success
,
he
would
do
best
to
break
free
from
van
damm
...
befor
it
's
too
late
.

if
he
continu
hi
involv
with
b-grade
movi
such
as
_
knock_off
_
,
the
respect
he
ha
from
hk
action
fan
will
continu
to
diminish
...
that
is
,
if
it
ha
n't
alreadi
disappear
entir
after
thi
fiasco
.
