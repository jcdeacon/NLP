,

opinion
that
the

ar
so
goofi
and
so
unawar

're

someon

someon
begin
to
send
letter
to
all
four
of
the
teen
with
the
frighten
messag
:
``
i
know
what
you
did
last
summer
.
''

the
letter-writer
-lrb-
a
figur
in
a
rubber
slicker
wield
a
larg
metal
hook
-rrb-
soon
make
hi
presenc
known
and
begin
to
hunt
down
the
four
teen
.

it
's
now
up
to
the
four
of
them
to
try
to
figur
out
who
the
killer
is
befor
it
's
too
late
.

while
thi
movi
ha
some
nice
visual
eeri
effect
,
too
much
of
it
's
impact
had
to
be
gener
with
extrem
close-up
,
while
the
level
of
suspens
wa
choppi
at
best
.

there
is
so
much
more
that
thi
movi
could
have
been
,
but
decid
to
give
us
noth
but
cheap
thrill
.

it
could
have
been
a
clever
whodunit
,
but
discov
who
ultim
wa
the
killer
made
me
just
shrug
my
shoulder
.

it
could
have
explor
the
chang
friendship
after
a
year
of
adulthood
,
but
seem
to
onli
includ
that
aspect
to
addmor
minut
to
the
film
.

it
could
have
given
us
smarter
charact
who
knew
that
anytim
you
're
alon
and
you
see
shadowi
figur
move
about
,
you
do
n't
walk
toward
them
yell
``
hello
''
.

onc
you
yell
``
hello
''
,
you
can
expect
an
extrem
close-up
,
a
thunder
sound
effect
and
an
eeri
sound
music
puls
.

it
's
difficult
to
be
in
suspens
when
you
know
what
's
about
to
happen
.

the
onli
redeem
aspect
of
the
movi
is
that
i
now
have
a
neat
idea
for
a
halloween
costum
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
if
the
local
costum
store
sell
rubber
slicker
and
hook
.

the
horror
that
i
experienc
from
thi
film
is
realiz
that
i
actual
went
to
see
it
.
