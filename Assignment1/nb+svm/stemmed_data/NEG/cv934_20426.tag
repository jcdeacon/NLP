not
on
singl
scene
in
univers

:
the

ha
ani
origin
to
it
.

when
fuell
by
don
davi
'
loud
,
drive
music
score
,
the
film
's
mani
fight
becom
almost
passabl
,
but
mostli
ar
full
of
the
same
ol
'
jean-claud
move
.

director
mic

-lrb-
a
former

co-ordin
-rrb-
keep
the
action
come
at
a
rapid
pace
,
with
onli
a
few
token
seriou
moment
to
be
found
.

hi
past
work
is
evid
in
the
mani
moment
when
charact
ar
thrown
through
window
,
toss
off
of
build
or
sent
fly
through
the
air
thank
to
an
explos
.

if
onli
jean-claud
were
n't
get
so
old
and
slow
compar
to
younger
martial
art
film
actor
like
jet
li
,
rodger
could
probabl
have
made
a
decent
action
film
.

to
place
the
blame
squar
at
van
damm
's
feet
,
howev
,
is
an
injustic
.

i
'm
not
sure
that
anyon
,
not
even
robert
deniro
or
edward
norton
,
could
make
writer
william
malon
and
john
fasano
's
script
sound
good
.

on
particularli
pain
scene
is
when
erin
ask
luc
how
he
is
so
sure
that
the
aforement
strip
club
will
have
internet
access
.

he
cring
,
look
down
and
mutter
``
uh
...
uhm
...
thei
all
do
,
i
saw
it
on
60
minut
.

eh
he
he
he
''
the
script
's
and
inde
the
entir
film
's
onli
save
grace
is
goldberg
.

he
chew
up
everi
scene
he
is
in
,
obvious
enjoi
hi
role
immens
.

he
even
give
the
film
a
few
laugh
,
as
he
mutter
thing
like
``
i
realli
do
n't
like
that
gui
''
everi
time
he
fail
to
kill
luc
.

sadli
,
hi
presenc
is
not
enough
to
turn
univers
soldier
:
the
return
into
anyth
better
than
a
below-averag
action
film
that
truli
deserv
to
have
