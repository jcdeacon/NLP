thi
as

:
``
how
to
make
a
bank
robberi
film
in
the
90
's
''
.

karen
mccoi
-lrb-
kim
basing
-rrb-
is
a
bank
robber
who
just
got
out
on
parol
after
a
six-year
stai
at
the
state
prison
.

she
want
to
make
thing
right
and
go
straight
,
especi
with
the
fact
that
she
ha
a
six-year
old
son
out
there
who
doe
n't
even
know
she
's
aliv
.

awar
of
mccoi
's
bank
rob
expertis
,
snivel
bad

jack
schmidt
-lrb-
terenc
stamp
-rrb-
us
the
same
six-year
old
to
coerc
mccoi
into
return
to
her
past
.

he
want
mccoi
to
pull
off
an
elabor
heist
of
18
+
million
dollar
at
the
same
bank
she
got
caught
try
to
rob
six
year
earlier
,
which
,
by
the
wai
,
is
somehow
due
to
schmidt
.

and
if
she
refus
?

who
know
what
he
'll
do
to
the
kid
.

-lrb-
cue
sinist
laughter
-rrb-
thi
movi
is
so
pathet
piti
that
it
's
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
.

the
aforement
clich
ar
brutal
abund
.

i
ca
n't
stress
enough
how
everi
singl
element
,
whether
it
be
a
charact
,
the
dialogu
,
a
plot
``
twist
''
,
etc.
,
is
so
damn
gener
that
you
'll
wonder
if
anyon
is
work
behind
the
scene
,
let
alon
in
front
of
the
camera
.

basing
is
absolut
vacant
.

and
where
do
thei
get
off
try
to
make
us
emotion
attach
to
her
?

here
's
someon
that
spent
their
time
rob
bank
,
and
now
as
she
head
onto
the
street
,
we
're
suppos
to
feel
sorri
for
her
.

as
she
confront
her
son
,
who
doe
n't
even
know
who
she
is
,
ar
we
suppos
to
break
into
tear
??

especi
when
neither
basing
nor
zach
english
,
who
plai
the
kid
,
ha
ani
depth
or
emot-radianc
whatsoev
.

i
suppos
i
should
mention
val
kilmer
.

yeah
,
that
's
right-he
's
in
it
!

quit
sadli
too
,
see
as
how
i
can
discuss
everyth
about
the
movi
and
never
mention
hi
name
.

and
he
got
second
bill
!

to
be
fair
,
i
will
admit
that
kilmer
had
potenti
in
hi
role
as
the
bumbl
crimin
wannab
j.t.
barker
.

unfortun
the
script
doe
n't
allow
much
room
for
improv
,
and
when
hi
charact
is
us
like
bookend
-lrb-
he
never
show
up
in
the
middl
of
the
film
!
-rrb-

,
we
have
no
time
to
appreci
what
he
might
have
brought
to
thi
project
.

the
real
mccoi
just
ca
n't
keep
it
's
head
abov
water
,
and
soon
,
veri
soon
,
sink
into
a
clich
mess
of
movi
.

the
actor
ar
like
dummi
be
move
about
by
an
unenthusiast
puppet
,
and
the
dialogu
,
particularli
schmidt
's
trite
dialogu
,
fall
like
the
niagra
.

thi
is
definit
on
to
avoid
,
folk
.

the
real
mccoi
is
anyth
but
!
