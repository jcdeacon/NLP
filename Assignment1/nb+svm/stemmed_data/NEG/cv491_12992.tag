me
roll
on
the
floor

.

thi
movi
plai
more
like
an
hbo
sketch
comedi
than
a
movi
.

it
's
a
on
note
concept
.

mitch
and
sam

lead
them
to
plot
against
the
rich
businessman
on
the
night
of
the
grand
open
of
a
new
opera
hous
.

first
the
critic
in
me
.

the
plot
is
the
standard
poor
gui
vs
evil
rich
gui
devic
,
where
the
main
charact
meet
the
girl
of
hi
dream
along
the
wai
.

here
's
the
catch
.

none
of
the
charact
ar
sympathet
.

thei
're
all
selfish
jerk
who
do
n't
care
who
thei
hurt
in
their
attempt
to
do
whatev
thei
want
.

the
joke
ar
juvenil
,
crude
,
appeal
to
the
worst
element
in
peopl
.

there
's
joke
about
prostitut
,
the
homeless
,
beastial
,
anal
sex
.

there
's
even
a
subplot
that
's
develop
,
it
seem
,
onli
to
make
joke
about
infidel
and
incest
.

and
i
love
watch
it
.

i
wa
a
huge
fan
of
norm
macdonald
's
sarcast
,
to-the-point
comedi
on
saturdai
night
live
,
and
thi
movi
is
an
hour
and
a
half
of
it
.

norm
macdonald
take
a
joke
,
strip
it
to
the
core
,
and
tell
it
like
it
is
with
a
dry
wit
.

like
the
scene
were
he
and
hi

a
new
construct
job
.

the
foreman
goe
over
the
basic

which
mitch
and
sam
do
n't
understand
.

how
do
thei
get
out
of
it
?

by

their
resum
,
and
do
n't
know
a
thing
about

and
surpris
,
thei
get
fire
.

the
charact
ar
incred
mean-spirit
.

there
's
a
father
who
's

and
obnoxi
,
a
gambl

doctor
plai
by
chevi
chase
who
tell

''

the
businessman
cole
who
alwai

mitch
and
sam
,
who
,
think
thei
can
get
$
50000
by
destroi
a

ponder
how
their
action
would
ruin
the
live
of
the
resid
.

``
too
bad
we
have
to
do
it
,
''

the
film
is
honest
,
and
make
no
mistak
that
it
is
anyth
more
than

and
it
is
n't

the
core
,
the
attitud
of
the
