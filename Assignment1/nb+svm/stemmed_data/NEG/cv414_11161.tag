a

wai
to
go

krippendorf
,
on

hand
,
is
see

go
down

not

onli
creat
more

more

on

oppos
end
is

ruth

,
an

whose
jealousi
drive
her
on
a
mission
to
disprov
the
exist
of
the
non-exist
tribe
.

it
's
a
cute
idea
,
and
approach
with
a
more
subtl
-lrb-
and
matur
-rrb-
style
,
krippendorf

could
've
been
a

you

a

warn

forget

do
you
want
