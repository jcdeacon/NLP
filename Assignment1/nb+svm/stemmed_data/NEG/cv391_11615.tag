but
thi
fast-pace
,
razor-sharp
turn
of
event
doe

leav
much
time
to

,
particularli
when

and
take
plenti
of
precaut
to
insur
you
'll
be
soak
from

when

fall
flat
,
and
when
thei
do

.

natur

is
thrown
into
a
state
of
panick
shock
at
these
accus
.

but
the
otherwis
unsubstanti
fabric
soon
lead
to
a
crimin
trial
when
a
low-class
,
marijuana
smoke
student
by
the
name
of
suzi
toller
-lrb-
campbel
-rrb-
come

with
a
near
ident
stori
,
also
involv
her

guidanc
counselor
.

pit
himself
against
the
commun
most
respect
name
and
authoritarian
,
sam
must
prove
hi
innoc
thru
the
aid
of
hi
makeshift
defens
attornei
,
ken
bowden
,
plai
by
bill
murrai
.

ye
,
that
bill
murrai
!

sound
like
a
good
,
complet
movi
?

ye
,
that
alon
could
have
been
,
but
thi
is
just
the
begin
.

in
fact
,
the
trial
is
over
about
fifteen
or
twenti
minut
into
the
film
.

it
is
mere
us
to
launch
the
most
twist
stori
of
recent
time
.

by
the
time
the
movi
finish
,
you
will
have
gone
thru
everi
plot
twist
imagin
.

unfortun
,
with
so
much
go
on
,
you
're
not
given
enough
time
in
on
predica
to
be
as
effect
shock
when
a
new
twist
come
about
.

thi
is
just
on
wai
director
john
mcnaughton
fail
to
make
thi
movi
as
fun
as
it
could
've
been
.

the
113
minut
fly
by
,
and
although
it
never
feel
underdevelop
,
thi
pretzel
of
storytel
could
've
been
much
more
richli
realiz
had
a
slower
pace
been
taken
.

the
act
is
incred
reminisc
of
fox
prime-time
soap
opera
,
which
no
,
is
not
a
good
thing
.

and
it
's
not
just
campbel
,
who
happen
to
hail
from
the
prime-time
fox
soap
``
parti
of
five
''
,
but
everyon
suffer
from
heavili
melodramat
overton
.

dillon
,
who
wa
so
charm
in
hi
underst
role
in
last
year
's
in
&
out
,
give
the
best
perform
,
and
murrai
's
surpris
appear
add
some
comed
flare
to
the
film
.

in
fact
,
if
the
whole
movi
had
been
promot
as
a
subtl
comedi
,
even
if
it
wa
the
exact
same
film
,
i
would
actual
give
it
a
better
grade
.

that
's
how
cheezi
it
come
off
.

but
asid
from
these
two
,
the
rest
offer
noth
more
than
some
good
ey-full
's
.

in
the
right
hand
,
wild
thing
could
've
been
a
wickedli
delight
,
scrumptious
twist
thriller
,
but
instead
we
get
juvenil
overus
of
profan
and
some
veri
laughabl
displai
of
act
.

and
what
's
up
with
these
peopl
pass
as
high
school
student
?

i
realiz
hollywood
often
cast
older
actor
to
plai
teenag
role
,
but
when
i
realiz
it
wa
n't
suppos
to
be
a
colleg
thei
were
at
,
i
had
to
snicker
.

i
wo
n't
lie-thi
is
definit
a
guilti
pleasur
.

as
corni
as
it
is
,
it
's
got
some
interest
aspect
and
could
deserv
at
least
a
``
b
''
for
effort
.

but
if
you
just
want
to
admir
denis
richard
,
go
for
last
year
's
starship
trooper
,
which
wa
everi
bit
as
campi
,
but
a
million
time
better
.

of
cours
,
if
see
her
breast
is
your
most
import
goal
,
you
'll
be
right
at
home
with
wild
thing
.

perhap
the
wildest
thing
of
all
is
that
somebodi
actual
look
at
thi
and
thought
it
deserv
to
be
in
theater
.
