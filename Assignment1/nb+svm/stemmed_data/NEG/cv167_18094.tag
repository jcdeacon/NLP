so
,
it
's
thirti
year
later
,
and
oscar
and
felix
ar
togeth
again
.

that
might
have
been
an
excit
notion
if
it
wa
n't
for
the
fact
that
the
``
odd
coupl
''
of
jack
lemmon
and
walter
matthau
have
been
reunit
in
sever
recent
movi
:
1993
's
``
grumpi
old
men
,
''
1995
's
``
grumpier
old
men
,
''
and
1997
's
``
out
to
sea
''
-lrb-
i.e.
``
grumpiest
old
men
''
-rrb-
.

so
,
``
the
odd
coupl
ii
''
-lrb-
i.e.
``
the
grumpiest
old
men
of
all
,
realli
''
-rrb-
seem
just
anoth
entri
in
a
tire
seri
.

the
plot
is
even
similar
to
that
of
``
grumpi
old
men
''
in
that
lemmon
and
matthau
's
mismatch
charact
ar
brought
togeth
by
a
romanc
between
their
children
.

neil
simon

the

playwright
who
creat
oscar
and
felix
,
provid
the
screenplai
,
which
is
a
shock
,
becaus
the
script
is
a
piec
of
talentless
hackwork
from
begin
to
end
.

unlik
the

plai/movi
,
``

''
doe
n't
find
it
humor
in
the

instead
,
it

a

of

the
origin
1968
movi
``
the

remain
a
classic
comedi
.

it
introduc
the
motif
of
roommat-as-spous
that
ha
provid
gag
for

and
sitcom
ever
sinc
.

it
wa
the
second
out
for
the
lemmon/matthau
team
-lrb-
which
debut
in
1966
's
``
the

wa
delight
,
and
it

but
``

and
``

ar
just

-lrb-
you
can
add
lemmon

,
''
i.e.
``
grumpi

''
to
that
list

-rrb-

let

that
hollywood
offer

let
