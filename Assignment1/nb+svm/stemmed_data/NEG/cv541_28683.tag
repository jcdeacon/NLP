is
nowher
near
as
funni
as
it
predecessor
,
and
it
is
not

shawn

marlon
do
the
write
and
keenen
ivori
behind
the
camera
,
do
n't
try
.

what
defeat
them
is
the
genr
thei
have
chosen
to
spoof
.

the
first
movi-an
outrag
,
low-brow
,
savag
satir
of
teen
slasher
flick
such
as
scream
and
i
know
what
you
did
last
summer-succeed
becaus
of
it
take-no-prison
attitud
toward
a
type
of
film
that
wa
in
vogu
,
familiar
and
popular
.

in

the

which
,
if
you
look
at
the
gross
for
such
recent

offer
as
the
respect
remak
of
the
haunt

hous
on

hill
,
did
not
draw
audienc
nor
enter
the
cultur
psych
as
did
the
variou
teen

seri

doe
start
off
promis
with
a
wonder
spoof
of
the
exorcist
,
featur
jame
wood
in
the
max
von
sydow
role
and
veronica
cartwright
lampoon
ellen
burstyn
.

of
cours
split
pea
soup
is
the
punch
line-an
overabund
amount
,
which
offer
the
hope
that
the
rest
of
the
movi
will
be
just
as
tasteless
and
excess
.

but
thi
pre-credit
sequenc
ha
noth
at
all
to
do
with
the
main
action
,
which
featur
the
cast
member
from
the
origin
sign
up
to
spend
a
weekend
at
a
creepi
haunt
mansion
as
part
of
a
univers
class
project
.

some
of
the
joke
ar
as
scatolog
and
offens
as
in
the
origin
,
but
thei
lack
that
take-no-prison
bite
that
rais

the
height
of

mere

it
is
as
if
the
wayan
and
their
team
of
writer-at
least
seven
ar
credit-just
threw
idea
in
a
blender
and
hope
thei

thei

while
the
pace
of

left
you
breathless
,
the
sequel
move
with
the
speed
of
an
18-wheeler
carri
