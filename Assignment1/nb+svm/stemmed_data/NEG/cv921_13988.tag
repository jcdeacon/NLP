thi

thei
're

by

between

when
not

i
began
to
allevi
the

consid
how

gwyneth

,
who
wa
origin
in
the
run
for
the
part
and
can
verit
handl
a
spot-on
english
accent
.

if
noth
els
,
it
'd
at
least
be
highli
entertain
for
the
incongru
sight
of
the
vagu
twiggish
young
actress
kick
butt
.

the
stori
,
such
as
it
is
,
involv
the
ever-bemus
tandem
of

involv
our

'
superior
,
it
sound
far
better
than
it
plai
,
and
is
render
almost
indecipher
by
blatant
post-product
tinker
;
it
's
clearli
evid
that
the
pictur
ha
been
cut
to
shred
.

the
aveng
wa
never
about
grip
drama
,
and
our
hero
accordingli
never
take
villain
sir
august
veri
serious
,
but
given
the
lack
of
cohes
in
the
plot
and
the
lack
of
menac
convei
by
the
buffoonish
maniac
,
it
's
all
decidedli
uncompel
.

mr.
conneri
,
who
's
onscreen
bare
long
enough
to
regist
an
impress
,
approach
the
role
like
a
man
fulfil
a
contractu
oblig
,
simultan
chew
the
sceneri
while
unabl
to
hide
hi
disinterest
.

at
least
it
all
look
good
.

thi
is
a
genuin
handsom
product
,
with
fine
costum
design
by
anthoni
powel
and
crispli
shot
by
roger
pratt
.

in
particular
,
the
gleam
product
design
by
stuart
craig
command
attent
,
adeptli
draw
element
both
old
and
new
in
order
to
depict
thi
great
britain
.

there
ar
a
hand
of
strike
visual
moment
in
the
film
,
includ
an
attack
by
a
swarm
of
giant
robot
bee
and
a
nice
shot
of
steed
and
peel
find
a
wai
to
walk
on
water
,
but
the
film
is
so
unremittingli
dull
that
even
these
instanc
fail
to
stir
interest
or
rais
puls
rate
.

by
the
time
the
film
's
climax
had
arriv
,
my
interest
wa
not
with
the
sight
of
steed
and
sir
august
slug
it
out
amidst
crash
wave
and
thunder
rain
,
but
with
the
quickest
escap
rout
from
the
theatr
.

not
coincident
,
the
entic
bit
of
visual
bravura
were
the
shot
assembl
into
the
movi
's
remark
trailer
,
a
savvi
piec
of
work
which
iron
is
infinit
more
appeal
that
the
featur
film
itself
;
the
first
promo
which
made
the
round
in
earli
spring
is
probabl
my
favourit
studio
trailer
so
far
thi
year
.

it
's
everyth
that
the
aveng
is
not
--
sauci
,
clever
,
engag
,
and
entertain
.

a
crush
disappoint
,
the
film
is
on
of
the
worst
out
of
the
year
--
too
drearili
aw
to
be
savour
as
gleefulli
bad
,
too
polish
to
overlook
it
defici
.

there
mai
be
upcom
pictur
that
ar
even
more
lifeless
than
the
aveng
,
but
i
sure
hope
not
.
