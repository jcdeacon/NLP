there

the

who
,
like

;
lola
struggl
with
her
charact

have

and
at
the
core

li
suzi
's
desir
to
travel
to
america
,
where
her
father
journei
after
leav
her
and
her
mother
year
ago
.

the
film
's
main
problem
is
that
potter
is
n't
skill
enough
to
tell
the
epic-size
stori
of
suzi
.

the
time
period
's
instabl
,
the
conflict
social
class
,
the
prejudic
against
suzi
from
all
those
around
her
in
her
new
life
:
serv
as
both
writer
and
director
,
potter
throw
in
some
of
each
,
but
hardli
an
inch
of
depth
is
to
be
found
in
ani
.

by
the
time
the
sigh-induc
climax
hit
,
the
believ
and
complet
absenc
of
focu
leav
on
readi
to
leav
the
theater
.

the
film
's
fall
action
is
weirdli
unsatisfi
and
unlik
;
ar
we
realli
meant
to
believ
ani
of
thi
could
happen
?

contrastingli
,
in
it
move
final
scene
,
the
man
who
cri
strike
a
note
that
is
made
effect
in
it
ti
to
the
emot
begin
of
the
film
.

although
it
's
appar
that
potter
ca
n't
grasp
what
she
reach
,
i
'm
puzzl
as
to
why
she
reach
for
so
much
in
the
first
place
.

ricci
's
suzi
is
meant
to
be
the
film
's
core
:
from
the
extend
flashback
at
the
film
's
begin
to
the
quickli
drawn
end
,
everyth
seen
in
the
film
,
in
some
wai
,
relat
to
her
.

so
why
then
doe
potter
spend
so
much
time
on
subplot
involv
other
individu
?

the
charact
of
suzi
is
too
present
for
the
man
who
cri
to
work
as
an
ensembl
,
but
not
present
enough
for
the
film
to
be
ricci
's
.

the
almost
constant
lack
of
flow
and
on-note
tone
with
which
potter
depict
the
man
who
cri
ar
somewhat
improv
upon

and
then
there
's
the
music
.

from
minut
on
to
minut
nineti-seven
,
there
's
hardli
a
moment
when
the
waver
,
skill
voic
of
an
opera

or
the
rhythm
of
the

do
n't
