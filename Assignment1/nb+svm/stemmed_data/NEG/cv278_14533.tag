it
would
be
hard
to
choos
the
best
american
polit
thriller
.

some
peopl
would
probabl
pick
the
manchurian
candid
and
other
-lrb-
myself
includ
-rrb-
would
pick
seven
dai
in
mai
.

both
those
film
were
tens
exercis
in
chill
.

the
two
film
came
out
within
two
year
of
each
other
and
both
were
direct
by
the
same
man
,
john
frankenheim
.

but
that
wa
1962
and
1964
respect
.

for
most
of
the
rest
of
hi
career
frankenheim
ha
turn
out
some
decent
film
,
but
ha
shown
littl
of
the
promis
that
those
two
thriller
show
.

each
of
those
film
had
memor
charact
and
a
tens
plot
.

thei
had
almost
noth
in
the
wai
of
chase
or
gunplai
.

the
thrill
all
came
from
the
plot
.

ronin
is
like
a
film
made
by
anoth
man
.

somewher
behind
all
the
shoot
and
explos
and
car
chase
there
ar
the
rudiment
ofa
plot
,
but
we
see
onli
tini
piec
of
it
.

we
get
a
clue
here
and
on
there
as
to
what
is
go
on
but
j.
d.
zeik
's
screenplai
is
a
bit
obscur
.

the
film
begin
explain
that
a
ronin
is
a
masterless
samurai
.

when
a
samurai
ha
fail
in
the
job
of
protect
hi
master
from
death
,
he
becom
a
ronin
,
much
like
a
gunfight
in
the
american
west
.

if
you
miss
the
open
,
do
not
worri
.

thi
film
will
explain
again
what
a
ronin
is
.

sam
-lrb-
plai
by
robert
de
niro
-rrb-
is
the
modern
equival
of
a
ronin
.

he
is
a
free
agent
who
seem
to
have
realli
good
instinct
about
how
to
stai
aliv
the
world
of
a
profession
killer
.

he
clearli
wa
in
a
danger
busi
at
on
time
and
now
he
seem
to
be
drift
around
on
hi
own
somewher
in
franc
.

sam
is
recruit
from
a
montmartr
bar
by
dierdr
-lrb-
natascha
mcelhon
of
the
truman
show
-rrb-
,
an
irish
woman
,
to
be
part
of
an
action
to
steal
a
mysteri
metal
case
.

dierdr
is
veri
tight-lip
about
what
is
in
the
case
.

sam
join
a
team
of
four
other
:
vincent
-lrb-
jean
reno
of
the
profession/leon
and
mission
imposs
-rrb-
,
spenc
-lrb-
sean
bean
,
tv
's
richard
sharp
,
and
also
patriot
game
and
goldeney
-rrb-
,
and
gregor
-lrb-
stellan
skarsgard
of
break
the
wave
and
good
will
hunt
-rrb-
.

also
along
is
larri
-lrb-
skipp
suddeth
-rrb-
.

the
group
seem
to
know
their
busi
,
particularli
sam
,
but
each
is
in
hi
own
wai
cold
and
profession
with
hi
own
field
of
expertis
.

their
onli
human
side
seem
to
be
in
tension
among
the
member
of
the
team
.

the
stori
is
not
veri
easi
to
follow
.

it
is
never
clear
who
is
doubl-cross
whom
and
who
is
work
for
whom
.

somehow
russian
-lrb-
who
mai
or
mai
not
be
the
russian
mafia
-rrb-
and
irish
radic
ar
involv
try
to
get
their
hand
on
a
certain
metal
case
.

some
veri
good
actor
ar
involv
in
thi
film
.

on
wonder
what
thei
saw
in
the
script
.

the
charact
ar
mostli
on-dimension
profession
killer
.

thei
know
their
work
,
and
see
their
thought
pattern
add
some
interest
to
the
film
,
but
for
thi
group
deep
feel
between
two
peopl
is
team
up
with
anoth
killer
so
that
neither
is
kill
.

by
the
end
of
the
film
we
never
realli
got
to
know
anybodi
.

mayb
that
is
the
secret
of
why
such
good
actor
took
part
,
sinc
these
ar
not
veri
demand
charact
to
creat
.

in
addit
to
the
abov
charact
the
film
also
featur
jonathan
pryce
and
michael
lonsdal
-lrb-
the
latter
of
moonrak
and
of
the
superior
thriller
the
dai
of
the
jackal
-rrb-
.

as
a
reviv
of
a
sort
of
action
film
that
wa
popular
in
the
1960s
,
i
wa
hope
that
there
would
be
someth
here
to
grab
onto
and
enjoi
.

unfortun
there
ar
no
deep
charact
,
and
littl
to
make
us
care
who
eventu
end
up
with
the
metal
case
or
why
thei
want
it
.

i
rate
ronin
aon
thetoscal
and
aon
the-4
to
+4
scale
.

non-spoiler
:
incident
,
the
tale
of
theronin
ha
been
film
multipl
time
,
usual
under
the
titl
chushingura
or
as
theronin
.

also
on
frequent
see
in
japanes
art
the
imag
of
a
man
break
down
a
door
with
a
huge
mallet
.

thi
is
the
first
blow
of
the
47
ronin
.
