-rrb-
,
who
's
wise
to
hi
niec
's
ploi
for
attent
and
ha
mafia
connect
.

for
at
least
a
half-hour
,
``
excess
baggag
''
bounc
along
fast
and
effici
.

dure
thi
time
,
emili
and
vincent
sport
engag
person
as
well
as
a
nice
role-revers
twist
--
she
's
an
awfulli
aggress
,
comb
victim
and
he
's
quit
the
aloof
,
seemingli
vulner
captor
.

but
onc
it
's
past
it
set-up
,
the
situat
suddenli
becom
uninvolv
as
the
stori
tri
to
be
too
mani
thing
at
onc
.

a
road
movi
,
a
teen
comedi
,
a
mob
thriller
,
a
drama
about
famili
relationship
--
you
name
the
clich
and
``
excess
baggag
''
like
cover
it
territori
.

of
cours
a
romanc
develop
between
the
two
lead
,
but
it
all
seem
forc
,
and
thu
character
is
manipul
to
caus
the
final
happi
outcom
.

``
do
you
like
my
tummi
?
''

emili
coo
to
vincent
at
on
point
in
the
film
.

huh
?

did
i
miss
someth
?

the
hard-edg
,
foul-mouth
grrrl
is
suddenli
gone
and
replac
with
a
pair
of
bat
goo-goo
ey
.

then
again
,
``
excess
baggag
''
becom
so
weak
in
so
mani
area
that
the
person
transplant
is
not
a
complet
surpris
.

a
support
cast
attempt
to
do
what
thei
can
with
color
but
empti
secondari
role
,
but
the
movi
is
n't
game
enough
to
us
them
all
and
therefor
seem
overcrowd
.

motiv
keep
shift
,
result
in
an
often
confus
narr
.

scant
exist
stori
background
confus
matter
even
wors
and
add
to
the
grow
list
of
unansw
question
.

``
excess
baggag
''
ha
too
mani
charact
,
too
much
plot
and
juggl
with
on
arm
behind
it
back
and
a
remain
shaki
hand
.

i
love
silverston
's
turn
in
``
clueless
''
as
an
aloof
,
pamper
beverli
hill
matchmak
inspir
by
jane
austen
's
``
emma
.
''

look
back
at
the
skill
she
displai
for
comedi
there
,
it
's
simpl
to
justifi
ani
high
expect
or
enthusiasm
that
i
had
muster
for
``
excess
baggag
.
''

sadli
,
howev
,
``
excess
baggag
''
is
no
``
clueless
.
''

but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
clueless
.
