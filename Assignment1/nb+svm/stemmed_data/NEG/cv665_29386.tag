review
:
given
the
absurd
of
it
would-be
plot
,
it
's
unlik
that
``
origin
sin
''
could
have
been
turn
into
a
reput
piec
of
filmmak
,
regardless
of
writer
,
director
or
star
.

thi
is
,
at
it
heart
,
b-movi
junk
:
a
lurid
melodrama
which
appeal
to
neither
the
brain
nor
the
heart
but
to
the
nether
region
.

that
said
,
``
origin
sin
''
could
at
least
have
becom
enjoy
junk
had
the
filmmak
embrac
it
trashi
and
indulg
in
it
.

instead
,
cristof
seem
to
have
mistaken
thi
for
a
seriou
product
,
and
direct
it
as
such
.

the
result
is
a
vapid
,
uninterest
morass
of
obviou
cross
and
doubl
cross
,
as
like
to
incit
a
yawn
as
a
thrill
.

consid
the
initi
sex
scene
between
bandera
and
joli
:
brightli-lit
and
mostli
film
from
abov
,
it
look
like
an
excerpt
from
an
amateur
soft
porn
show
.

cristof
doe
n't
even
manag
to
captur
the
allur
of
cuba
;
instead
of
portrai
hi
set
as
a
steami
,
sensuou
island
paradis
,
it
appear
bland
and
lifeless
.

at
least
bandera
and
joli
manag
to
inspir
some
interest
;
there
ar
hint
at
time
that
thei
want
to
have
more
fun
with
the
script
,
but
ar
n't
be
given
the
chanc
.

the
same
can
not
be
said
of
jane
,
whose
billi
is
nebbish
and
transpar
.

also
unwis
is
the
joli
frame
sequenc
,
which
practic
give
awai
the
film
's
denouement
.
