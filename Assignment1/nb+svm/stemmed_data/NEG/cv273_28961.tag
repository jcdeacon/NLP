-rrb-
is
not
friendli
to
her
and
consid
her
to
be
a

becaus
of
the
wai
she

.

to
hammer
home
the
point
of
how
anti-semit
ha
n't
gone
awai
there
's
a
barrag
of
overdon
and
uninvolv
scene
with
a
sneer
concierg
-lrb-
bradlei
-rrb-
,
who
keep
make
nasti
remark
about
jew
and
tri
to
make
thing
inconveni
for
them
by
prevent
the
jewish
famili
from
us
the
elev
.

the
film
is
done
in
by
it
ham-fist
script
as
the
stori
,
adapt
from
carl
friedman
's
book
``
the
shovel
and
the
loom
,
''
goe
from
on
fals
note
to
anoth
until
it
get
lost
in
all
the
goo
of
it
sentiment
.

it
start
off
tell
chaja
's
stori
of
how
she
's
a
lost
jewess
try
to
find
her
ident
,
then
to
her
nanni
role
as
she
love
a
mute
child
stuck
in
an
insul
environ
,
and
then
it
make
it
a
stori
about
the
linger
effect
of
the
bitter
past
that
ca
n't
be
forgotten
.

the
effort
seem
heavi-hand
,
as
the
film
kept
deliv
too
mani
obviou
messag
that
it
ponder
kept
deliv
through
the
stock
charact
.

the
support
cast
consist
of
all
wooden
charact
who
give
their
role
a
cartoonish
flavor
:
chaja
's
parent
ar
given
no
human
shade
,
while
the
janitor
villain
wa
a
particularli
annoi
role
that
wa
on-dimension
and
fals
act
.

the
onli
on
who
fought
through
the
script
and
show
some
feel
were
fraser
,
whose
effervesc
face
wa
express
of
both
the
try
time
she
wa
go
through
and
the
joi
she
felt
--
but
most
admir
show
how
she
could
be
so
mistaken
as
to
think
that
she
could
forget
her
root
;
while
rossellini
gave
a
warm
perform
of
a
woman
suffer
in
silenc
,
but
is
strong
in
accept
her
faith
.

topol
's
reassur
perform
as
the
wise
man
who
sai
all
the
right
thing
to
fraser
,
act
as
the
true
voic
of
the
filmmak
in
explain
all
the
suffer
with
common
sens
.

the
film
brazenli
us
littl
simcha
to
get
across
it
agenda
of
point
out
how
the
patriarch
world
can
be
cruel
when
it
ca
n't
love
:
it
start
out
by
show
how
under
chaja
's
love
care
he
's
taken
to
the
duck
pond
and
soon
start
jabber
awai
,
begin
by
sai
`
quack
,
quack
'
and
then
go
on
to
ask
the
four
question
dure
a
passov
seder
.

but
by
show
how
the
boi
is
so
terrifi
of
hi
strict
father
that
he
wet
hi
pant
in
hi
presenc
,
refus
to
speak
becaus
of
hi
stern
dad
,
and
eventu
becom
the
victim
of
a
tragic
accid
,
the
film
therebi
exploit
the
boi
's
suffer
and
hi
stori
just
becom
tiresom
and
not
sincer
done
.

i
felt
i
did
n't
just
see
a
movi
,
but
i
attend
a
lectur
for
the
whole
100
minut
of
thi
seriou
but
unappet
stori
.

it
wa
the
kind
of
movi
that
you
hope
would
somehow
end
soon
,
as
it
seem
to
be
in
the
habit
of
rehash
it
same
viewpoint
unnecessarili
--
the
messag
it
keep
send
wa
alreadi
receiv
.

in
the
last
shot
where
father
and
daughter
ar
hopelessli
dig
for
the
lost
luggag
,
on
ha
the
impress
that
no
on
in
the
film
learn
anyth
about
themselv
or
the
past
.

that
seem
strang
,
sinc
i
thought
that
wa
what
thi
film
wa
suppos
to
be
about
.

unless
i
wa
mistaken
and
the
film
's
real
aim
wa
to
make
us
cry
over
simcha
.
