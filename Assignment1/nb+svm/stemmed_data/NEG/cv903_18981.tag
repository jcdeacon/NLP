do
n't
let
thi
movi
fool
you
into
believ
the
romant
noir
of
william
shakespear
.

no
on
will
truli
understand
the
heart
and
soul
of
thi
man
except
through
hi
work
,
and
thi
movi
make
a
vain
attempt
at
that
.

ani
move
to
glamoris
'
hi
life
,
which
hollywood
ha
an
annoi
tendenc
to
do
,
will
onli
subtract
from
hi
achiev
rather
than
expound
on
hi
great
.

thi
movi
about
hi
life
,
although
well
written
,
put
too
much
make-up
on
a
man
whose
life
wa
probabl
more
pork
and
potato
,
rather
than
lobster
and
champagn
.

oh
well
,
let
's
fantasis
onward
an
assum
that
he
wa
a
bit
of
a
flirtati
plai-write
,
who
fall
in
love
with
a
beauti
woman
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
and
from
her
inspir
,
sever
plai
develop-romeo
and
juliet
'
,
and
the
twelfth
night
'
.

it
is
easier
for
me
to
believ
that
he
had
a
wet
dream
and
that
's
how
all
hi
plai
develop
,
but
pleas
spare
me
all
of
thi
unnecessari
melodrama
.

but
i
guess
my
version
probabl
would
n't
draw
a
crowd
or
make
a
dollar
on
screen
.

so
is
there
ani
justif
in
romanticis
the
man
shakespear
,
when
all
we
need
to
do
is
read
hi
work
in
order
to
find
hi
soul
.

i
think
not
.

as
for
the
oscar
were
thei
deserv
by
thi
movi
?

i
think
not
.

in
mani
aspect
privat
ryan
'
and
life
is
beauti
'
were
far
superior
movi
,
but
on
should
never
assum
that
thi
should
be
a
criteria
for
win
an
oscar
,
as
time
and
again
,
for
reason
unexplain
,
an
undeserv
movi
will
win
the
accolad
.

anoth
sore
point
is
the
fact
that
gwyneth
won
the
best
femal
lead
,
over
a
more
polish
cate
,
but
i
guess
if
you
go
on
enough
about
your
grandfath
dy
and
your
nephew
be
hospitalis-peopl
will
start
feel
sorri
for
you
.
