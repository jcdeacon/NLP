the
plot
of
big
momma
's
hous
is
martin
lawrenc
in
a
fat
suit
and
a
dress
.

that
's
not
just
the
high-concept
premis
;
it
's
the
fulli-realiz
,
all-encompass
plot
.

such
an
emphasi
is
not
unheard-of
in
the
world
of
hollywood
summer
entertain
.

on
need
mere
look
back
to
last
summer
,
when
the
plot
of
big
daddi
wa
adam
sandler
be
an
incompet
surrog
parent
.

the
trap
inher
in
such
an
approach
is
that
the
high-concept
plot
idea
better
be
pretti
well-realiz
,
or
rest
on
the
shoulder
of
an
extrem
talent
perform
,
becaus
you
can
bet
there
will
be
noth
els
worth
a
second
of
your
time
--
not
a
develop
charact
,
not
a
provoc
theme
,
not
a
witti
twist
.

you
will
get
90-plu

of

unfortun

make

:
instead
of
have
the

it

utter

for

if
it
had

and
it
miss
it
best
possibl
opportun
for
some
great
farc
by
ignor
the
simpl
fact
that
the
real
big

is
set
up
as
a
foul-temper
beast
,
while
malcolm
ha
to

martin

can
be
likeabl
enough
at
time
,
but
there
's
no
reason
to
care
a
whit
about
hi
bud
romanc
with
sherri
becaus
malcolm
is
never
an
independ

he
's
just
big

without

on
.

i
wo

the
set-up
of
the
escap

is

,
sinc
it
wa
clearli
a
wast
of
time
to
the
film-maker
.

there
ar
a
few
token
scene
of
lester
loom
as
a

,
but
he
's
ultim
a
distract
in

about

the

i

never

underestim
how
appeal
that

--
sever

of

but
i
know
that
when
a

tri
to
throw
a
concept
at
me
and
pretend
that
it
's
an

,
i
duck
out

it
lack
of

might
have
been
toler

big

is
ridicul

and
_
not

it
's
just
