fact
that
charl
bronson
repres
on
of
the
most
import
movi
icon
of
the
1980s
repres
on
of
the
biggest
and
almost
tragic
ironi
of
that
decad
.

tragedi
li
in
the
fact
that
the
icon
statu
wa
earn
less
by
qualiti
of
hi
work
in
movi
,
but
the
quantiti
.

most
of
those
movi
were
produc
by
cannon
group
,
compani
led
by
isra
produc
menahem
golan
and
yoram
globu
.

those
two
men
probabl
thought
that
thei
could
be
the
next
roger
corman
,
b-movi
mentor
of
futur
hollywood
legend
.

unfortun
,
that
did
n't
happen
,
and
when
cannon
final
went
bankrupt
at
the
end
of
the
decad
,
behind
it
stood
the
huge
pile
of
cinemat
garbag
,
that
would
requir
at
least
few
centuri
befor
it
reach
the
camp
appeal
.

sadli
for
bronson
,
that
garbag
also
contain
numer
movi
in
which
that
capabl
charact
actor
and
action
hero
of
the
1970s
tri
to
rais
their
worth
simpli
by
be
the
main
lead
,
and
lower
hi
own
reput
in
process
.

on
the
other
hand
,
bronson
could
take
comfort
in
a
fact
that
those
movi
were
extrem
popular
,
especi
among
the
audienc
3
or
4
time
younger
than
bronson
himself
.

on
of
such
movi
that
serious
mar
bronson

reput
is

,
third

in
the

which

,
the
main
asset
in

movi
,
plai
the
charact
who
is
noth
more
than
an

although
bronson
's

doe

and

-rrb-
,
the
lack
of
emot
or
bronson
's
own
commit
could
be
seen
in
a
veri

spoken
in

the

order
to
give

on

much
better

enough
to
exercis
their
reign
of
terror
on

,
and
stupid
enough
to
be

unfortun

michael

doe
n't
know
how
to
work
out
the

and
after
tortur
the
viewer
with

end
thi

with
a
bang
.

the
big
showdown
at
the
end-that
turn
east
new
york
into
the
sarajevo-like
battl
zone-is
probabl
the
worst
part
of
the
movi
,
becaus
of
the
poor
edit
and
the
cheap
set
and
prop
that
give
awai
the
low
budget
.

in

,
thi

to

for
