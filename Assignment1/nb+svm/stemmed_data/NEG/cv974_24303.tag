and
leav

novale
then
decid
to
secretli
hole
up
in
the
wal-mart
-lrb-
becaus
she
's
not
the
brightest
bulb
in

then

,
break
the
heart
of
the

that
save

,
receiv
an

,
build
a
martha
stewart-esqu
hous
,
becom
an
award-win
photograph
,
and
manag
to
alwai
look
like
she
step
out
of
a
cosmo
shoot
,
all
while
not
onc
do
anyth
with
her
kid
.

thi
film
is
terribl
.

the
direct
is
aw
:
it
seem
director
matt
william
had
an
index
card
with
six
angl
written
on
it
and
us
everi
on
of
them
,
over
and
over
and
over
again
.

we
get
pathet
and
ugli
act
by
natali
portman
,
who
can
do
good
work
.

a
disjoint
pace
of
kei
scene
and
a
time
structur
so
confus
that
it
would
throw
steve
prefontain
off
.

a
subplot
that
actual
valid
the
action
of
the
boyfriend
who
abandon
novale
in
the
wal-mart
park
lot
.

an
embarrass
displai
of
emot
by
the
charact
,
make
the
audienc
ill
.

take
two
great
comed
screenwrit
,
babaloo
mandel
and
lowel
ganz
,
and
forc
them
to
write
drama
on
par
with
oprah
's
book
club
.

altogeth
,
it
ha
the
feel
of
be
trap
at
home
,
watch
a
veri
bad
televis
mini-seri
and
wish
it
to
end
,
onli
the
remot
is
broken
.

howev
,
the
main
problem
with
the
film
is
that
it
never
answer
the
most
poignant
question
brought
up
:
where
is
the
heart
?

no
on
ever
seem
to
find
it
in
thi
piec
of
junk
.
