the

at

,
and
a
full-fledg
member
of
the
popular
crowd
.

doe
thi
mean
that
popular
is
the
kei
to
get
awai
with
murder
?

or
will
thi
fine
hone
plan
crack
over
time
?

jawbreak
is
obvious
attempt
to
be
the
heather
of
it
gener
,
and
fail
miser
,
i
might
add
.

it
manag
to
captur
the
mix
of
murder
and
teen
social
observ
,
but
miss
three
crucial
element
:
sharp
dialogu
,
witti
charact
and
the
much-need
humor
.

it
is
possibl
that
jawbreak
might
have
succeed
in
be
-lrb-
darkli
-rrb-
humor
if
it
wa
n't
shackl
to
it
dead-weight
plot
.

the
film
's
most
innov
twist
is
the
makeov
of
fern
mayo
.

at
thi
point
,
jawbreak
seem
pois
to
spin
wildli
into
the
unchart
depth
.

but
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
the
innov
stop
.

the
film
becom
mire
in
the
murder-and-cover-up
plot
,
which
quickli
sap
what
littl
life
and
energi
there
wa
right
out
of
the
film
.

in
the
film
,
rose
mcgowan
fare
the
best
.

as
the
manipul
cliqu
leader
,
she
truli
domin
everi
scene
she
's
in
-lrb-
not
a
difficult
feat
in
a
crowd
such
as
thi
,
howev
-rrb-
.

it
's
a
charact
cry
out
for
a
better
movi
-lrb-
or
at
least
anoth
decent
drawn
charact
with
which
to
interact
.
-rrb-

jawbreak
doe
n't
quit
know
how
to
handl
it
semi-likabl
charact
:
fern
and
juli
.

either
on
could
effect
end
the
movi
at
ani
time
by
simpli
reveal
what
she
know
.

the
length
to
which
the
film
goe
to
prolong
the
plot
have
the
unintent
effect
of
distanc
us
from
these
charact
.

as
their
motiv
becom
murki
and
unclear
,
the
film
final
fall
to
the
point
that
it
doe
n't
realli
matter
who
win
or
lose
,
sinc
all
side
have
becom
equal
detest
.

``
detest
''
is
a
good
word
to
describ
the
film
,
jawbreak
.

it
's
certain
that
,
like
the
murder
weapon
describ
in
the
film
's
titl
,
jawbreak
will
be
trigger
more
than
on
gag
reflex
in
the
audienc
.
