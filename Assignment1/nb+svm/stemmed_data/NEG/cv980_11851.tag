is
do
well
.

with
earli
success
with
westworld
-lrb-
1973
-rrb-
and
coma
-lrb-
1978
-rrb-
,
and
recent
film
such
as
jurass
park
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
,
hi
film
have
been
entertain
.

howev
,
he
seem
to
taken
a
wrong
turn
somewher
with
sphere
.

thi
$
100
million
mess
by
good
director
barri
levison
-lrb-
disclosur
-rrb-
is
dull
,
long
wind
,
and
a
huge
disappoint
.

consid
the
huge
budget
,
the
all
star
cast
,
and
a
stori
by
crichton
,
sphere
is
majorli
disappoint
.

the
film
open
with
norman
goodman
-lrb-
hoffman
-rrb-
,
a
psychologist
who
think
he
is
visit
an
airplan
crash
to
consol
the
survivor
.

howev
,
when
he
arriv
,
he
hi
told
by
supervisor
barn
-lrb-
peter
coyot
-rrb-
that
he
is
actual
investig
an
spacecraft
.

along
with
goodman
is
mathematician
harri
adam
-lrb-
jackson
-rrb-
,
biologist
beth
halperin
-lrb-
stone
-rrb-
and
ted
field
-lrb-
liev
schrieber
.
-rrb-

thei
investig
the
spaceship
,
find
a
massiv
sphere
insid
,
meet
an
alien
intellig
call
jerri
,
and
basic
weird
crap
happen
.

unfortun
,
someth
went
wrong
along
the
wai
with
sphere
.

the
film
start
off
entertain
enough
,
but
throughout
thi
veri
long
movi
,
it
just
get
sillier
and
sillier
.

the
film
jaunt
along
from
scene
to
scene
,
never
fulli
explain
what
is
go
on
.

the
actor
and
direct
do
n't
help
,
either
.

hoffman
is
on
autopilot
-lrb-
and
almost
seem
embarrass
-rrb-
throughout
the
movi
,
churn
out
dull
line
,
and
probabl
wonder
what
the
hell
he
is
do
in
thi
movi
.

stone
is
useless
,
displai
no
emot
,
and
fail
to
convinc
the
audienc
that
she
ha
ani
feel
for
hoffman
.

the
onli
person
who
seem
to
be
have
fun
in
thi
movi
is
jackson
,
who
's
funni
as
the
mathematician
who
slowli
goe
crazi
and
enter
the
sphere
.

but
he
's
hardli
in
it
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
film
he
is
just
as
dull
as
hoffman
and
stone
.

the
same
goe
for
peter
coyot
,
who
ham
it
up
as
the
offic
,
but
is
then
kill
off
halfwai
through
.

the
director
,
barri
levinson
,
who
direct
the
better
crichton
adapt
disclosur
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
mess
up
with
the
drama
and
the
action
.

the
drama
scene
ar
,
quit
frankli
,
bore
,
and
the
action
scene
suffer
from
overkil
,
with
levison
throw
the
camera
all
over
the
place
-lrb-
much
like
the
godaw
speed
2
,
1997
-rrb-
the
write
doe
n't
help
much
,
either
.

although
crichton
is
great
with
plot
,
he
's
terribl
with
dialogu
,
and
practic
everi
line
in
sphere
is
a
dud
.

the
speech
is
too
simpl
,
i
wa
hope
it
would
be
a
bit
more
intellig
.

practic
everi
line
is
just
state
the
obviou
.

none
of
it
is
smart
.

also
,
where
the
hell
did
the
budget
go
?

the
sphere
itself
is
impress
,
and
there
's
a
few
nice
special
effect
shot
,
but
where
the
$
100
million
went
is
anyon
's
guess
.

there
's
a
giant
squid
attack
in
the
pictur
,
but
not
onc
doe
the
audienc
see
the
squid
,
even
though
the
film
ha
a
massiv
budget
.

i
assum
the
pictur
wa
try
to
build
up
tension
by
not
show
the
squid
,
and
if
handl
correctli
it
probabl
would
.

but
the
whole
scene
is
done
badli
,
and
i
wa
just
hope
we
could
see
the
stupid
squid
.

final
,
the
film
ha
no
idea
what
genr
to
be
.

levison
ca
n't
handl
hi
own
plot
.

it
leap
from
hokei
sci-fi
,
to
horror
,
and
final
the
shine/event
horizon
psycholog
thriller
.

and
,
of
cours
,
the
film
is
veri
much
like
the
abyss
-lrb-
1988
-rrb-
,
although
in
it
's
defens
,
crichton
did
write
sphere
befor
the
abyss
wa
releas
-lrb-
and
is
far
superior
to
thi
rubbish
.
-rrb-

it
's
not
all
that
bad
though
.

the
plot
is
all
right
,
there
's
a
few
jump
scene
-lrb-
although
noth
veri
scari
-rrb-
and
there
's
the
occasion
interest
bit
.

but
overal
,
sphere
is
a
big
wast
of
some
fine
talent
,
a
lot
of
monei
,
and
a
potenti
good
movi
.

not
realli
worth
see
.
