not
a
bad
thing
to
updat
old
stori
.

it
's
done
all
the
time
in
the
oral
tradit
.

the
difficulti
with
thi
film
is
not
that
the
tale
ha
chang
,
it
's
that
it
's
dry
.

the
new

daniel
-lrb-
drew
barrymor
-rrb-
is
not
sit
around
wait
for
her
princ
to
come

she
's
a
woman
of
the
late
twentieth
centuri
albeit
situat
in
sixteenth

franc
.

when
her
father

happili
ever
after
.

the
movi
is
often
like
watch
a
film
plai
.

theater
in
real
life
is
engross
.

theater
on
the
screen
is
usual
lifeless
.

there
doe
n't
seem
to
be
much
go
on
.

the
camera
can
be
a
star
of
film
.

here
it
's
a
co-conspir
.

daniel
's
convict
ar
compromis
.

a
socialist
and
a
feminist
,
she
pretend
to
be
royalti
to
get
her
man
.

a
kind
woman
,
her
last
act
in
the
movi
is
on
of
reveng
.

the
most
enjoy
charact
ar
the
most
cartoonish
.

the
fairi
godmoth
stand-in
,
leonardo

is
fun
to
watch
as
the
eccentr
old
man
who
advis
daniel

huston
is
enjoy
in
her
over-the-top
wicked
.

in
all
fair

mayb
it
's
on
of
those
``
chick
flick
''
that
