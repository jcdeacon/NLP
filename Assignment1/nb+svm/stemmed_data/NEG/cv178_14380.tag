perman

is
a
pretti
bad
movi
,
though
it
took
me
a

dai
to

.

the
film
is
more
masturbatori
than

,
with
it
main
charact
intent
on

ben

stahl
,
a
young
author
who
arriv
in

with
ambit
and
a

with

insert

.

perman
midnight
is
structur
mostli
as
a
flashback
,
with
recov
addict
bello
meet
stiller
-lrb-
at
a
fastfood
restaur
,
where
stiller
work
the
drive-thru
as
part
of
rehab
-rrb-
,
take
him
back
to
a
hotel
,
and
between
bout
of
seriou
screw
,
listen
to
hi
life
stori
.

i
've
spent
the
last
week
try
to
figur
out
why
stiller
never
seem
to
find
the
frighteningli
gorgeou
hurlei
attract-wors
,
i
've
been
try
to
figur
out
why
hurlei
did
find
stiller
attract
.

as
stahl
,
stiller
displai
none
of
the
charm
or
wit
on
would
expect
-lrb-
post-there
's
someth
about
mari
-rrb-
of
either
the
actor
or
a
comedi
writer
.

what
separ
stahl
from
the
hundr
of
other
hollywood
punk-junki
,
it
seem
,
is
that
stahl
wrote
a
book
about
hi
idioci
.

watch
stahl
shoot
heroin
next
to
a
babi
!

watch
stahl
spoil
numer
pitch
meet
with
smack-fuel
babbl
!

stiller
give
a
technic
flawless
perform
:
the
film
could
doubl
as
a
documentari
on
how
to
be
a
junki
.

but
perman
midnight
is
mostli
soulless
.

when
the
movi
pose
the
question
will
stahl
be
save
?

and
then
answer
it
in
the
form
of
bello
's
charact
-lrb-
basic
a
shrink
in
black
panti
-rrb-
,
could
a
person
care
less
?

in
the
film
version
of
hi
autobiographi
of
the
same
name
,
stahl
doe
n't
need
save
,
he
need
someon
who
will
sit
there
and
listen
to
him
go
on
about
himself
.

if
you
learn
anyth
about
the
other
charact
in
thi
movi
,
it
's
that
thei
ar
the
most
incred
toler
hollywood-type
known
to
man
.

-lrb-
stahl
also
seem
to
be
the
onli
person
at
schmooz
parti
do
drug
.

is
thi
hollywood
...
california
?
-rrb-

i
learn
veri
littl
about
the
entertain
busi
from
perman
midnight
and
a
whole
lot
about
an
egotist
lunkhead
.

of
cours
you
know
that
stahl
triumph
becaus
he
live
to
talk
about
hi
problem
.

so
,
basic
,
hi
drug
habit
got
him
a
book
deal
,
a
movi
base
on
hi
life
,
and
now
he
's
appar
collabor
with
stiller
on
futur
project
.

so
much
for
the
moral
of
that
stori
.

temporari
midnight
is
more
like
