a
bleak
indi
film
about
a

there
's
not

but
the
stori
is
so
fill
with
violenc
and
it
nyc
set
look
like
hell
,
that
it
's
hard
to
enjoi
thi
film
and
to
follow
what
the
logic
in
the
stori
is
suppos
to
mean
.

the
relationship
between
the
black
mugger
and
hi
white
victim
is
a
cloudi
on
,
which
the
film
never
determin
what

call

not
tell
him
what

-rrb-
.

she
's
the
onli
on
in
the
film
who
could
act
.

the
film
is
stuck
with
a
clumsi
dialogu
and
an
overus
of
symbol
,
as
it
end
with
noth
more
to
tell
after
the
shock
and
the
violent
situat
it
creat
except
to
beat
it
into
the
ground
.

it
could
onli
be
commend
for
how
appeal
the
film
look
,
as
if
it
's
a
scrapbook
of
still
