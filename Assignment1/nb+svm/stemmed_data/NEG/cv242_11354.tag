``
is
just
on
long
promot
film
for
the
british
girl
band
the
spice
girl
.
''

sure
there
's
a
hint
of
humor
in
there
everi
onc
in
a
while
.

actual
,
there
's
a
coupl
of
pretti
good
jab
at
the
spice
girl
.

but
overal
,
who
care
?

not
me
.

if
you
do
n't
know
by
now
,
the
spice
girl
sing
song
of
love
and
friendship
and
respons
and
girl
power
,
yet
dress
like
streetwalk
from
a
lower
middl
class
neighborhood
.

in
``
spice
world
''
thei
ride
around
in
their
big
tour
bu
,
whine
about
have
to
do
photo
shoot
and
give
interview
.

amazingli
,
all
the
talk
thei

about
keep
commit
and
uphold
respons
onli
realli
appli

thing
,
thing
thei
want
to
do

not

and
thei
keep
babbl
about
``
girl
power
''
when
thei
should
realli
be
talk
about

cleavag
power

.

i
mean
,
if
all
it
take
is
girl
power
,
then
why
ar
thei
onli
on
thread
awai
from
burst
out

the
film
is
pg
,
but
realli
with
onli
some
veri
minor
dialogu
chang
and
scene
extent
,
you
'd
