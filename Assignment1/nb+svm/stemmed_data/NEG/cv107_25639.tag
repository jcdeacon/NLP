an

of

bad
dialogu
in

i
'll
admit
it
...
i
love
superman
iii
.

i
know
it
's
hate
amongst
the
superman
faith
who
dismiss
it
as
noth
more
than
a
vehicl
for
richard
pryor
,
but
i
still
think
it
's
a
worthi
addit
to
the
man
of
steel
franchis
.

supergirl
,
a
spin-off
film
of
sort
from
the
seri
'
same
produc
-lrb-
alexand
and
ilya
salkind
-rrb-
,
doe
n't
even
rival
superman
iii
in
term
of
qualiti
,
let
alon
superman
or
superman
ii
.

supergirl
lost
me
from
the
open
scene
and
went
steadili
downhil
for
the
rest
of
it
two
hour
plu
run
time
.

as
the
film
begin
we
see
the
resid
of
argo
citi
,
a
commun
like
place
consist
of
refuge
from
krypton
which
resid
in
``
inner
space
''
,
go
about
their
daili
live
.

ok
...
what
?

so
these
ar
exil
from
krypton
,
which
blew
up
right
?

were
thei
live
there
befor
krypton
explod
?

how
do
you
get
to
``
inner
space
''
?

thi
whole
``
inner
space
''
notion
is
never
explain
,
particularli
in
term
of
how
these
peopl
get
inform
from
the
outsid
world
.

how
do
thei
know
where
superman
went
?

how
do
thei
know
he
took
the
name
clark
kent
and
now
work
at
the
daili
planet
?

these
kind
of
thing
frustrat
the
hell
out
of
me
.

argo
citi
is
kept
run
by
a
power
sourc
call
the
omegahedron
.

on
dai
the
founder
of
argo
citi
,
zaltar
-lrb-
peter
o

-rrb-
,
give
the
omegahedron
to
superman

,
kara
-lrb-
helen

-rrb-
,
for
us
as
inspir
in

kara
us
it
to
creat
a
bug-like
thing
which
immedi
crash
through
the
layer
of
``
whatev
''
that
protect
the
citi
.

in
the
chao
,
the
omegahedron
sail
out
through
the
open
,
doom
the
argonian
to
death
...
in
three
dai
time
,
or
someth
.

kara
then
climb
into
a
pod
which
zaltar
had
design
for
interdimension
travel
and
chase
after
the
omegahedron
to
save
her
world
.

the
power
sourc
travel
directli
to
earth
and
land
in
the
bowl
of
dip
belong
to
a
minor-leagu
witch
name
selena

announc
her
desir
to
rule
the
world
to
her
sometim
warlock
boyfriend
nigel
-lrb-
peter

-rrb-
.

selena
somehow
know
that
thi
ball
from
the
sky
will
help
her
with
her
evil
plan
,
and
she
set
out
to
achiev
world
domin
.

selena
is
unawar
of
cours
that
kara
ha
also
arriv
on

,
and
that
she
's
arriv
as
supergirl
-lrb-

costum
-rrb-
.

supergirl
emerg
from
the
bottom
of
a
lake
when
she
arriv
.

ok
...
huh
?

why
doe
the
omegahedron
fall
from
the
sky
but
supergirl
shoot
out
of
the
bottom
of
a
lake
?

attent
movi
:
explain
yourself
!

i
'm
sorri
,
i
can
onli
suspend
disbelief
so
much
.

i
ca
n't
bui
into
ani
of
thi
nonsens
just
becaus
the
movi
want
me
to
.

know
that
she
need
a
secret
ident
,
supergirl
basic
``
will
''
herself
into
a
school
girl
outfit
-lrb-
complet
with
a
differ
hairstyl
-rrb-
,
pick
the
alia
linda
lee
and
enrol
into
school
.

she
's
given
her
dorm
assign
,
and
who
happen
to
be
her
roommat
?

loi
lane
's
sister
,
luci
.

ok
,
coincid
is
on
thing
folk
,
but
we
're
get
realli
contriv
now
.

what
follow
ar
some
gener
all-girl
school
hijink
...
complet
with
evil
bulli
girl
-lrb-
mean
for
no
reason
,
of
cours
-rrb-
and
even
a
shower
scene
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
.

best
moment
though
come
when
supergirl
decid
to
put
a
bra
on
over
her
school
uniform
and
start
stuf
it
with
sock
.

at
thi
point
i
'm
rapidli
wonder
why
i
'm
bother
with
thi
nonsens
.

there
is
some
credit
to
give
to
the
film
howev
.

on
lengthi
and
elabor
sequenc
featur
an
``
evil
''
bulldoz
destroi
a
small
town
in
search
of
it
``
prei
''
is
veri
well
done
.

also
,
it
commend
to
see
gender
revers
in
the
film
,
wherea
the
women
have
all
the
power
and
the
men
ar
mere
object
and
tool
.

hart
bochner
-lrb-
die
hard
-rrb-
is
particularli
fun
as
kara
's
love
interest
,
a
lovesick
landscap
who
is
under
a
spell
cast
by
selena
-lrb-
although
he
is
unfortun
part
of
on
of
the
film
's
more
ridicul
moment
,
when
he
ha
to
be
rescu
from
be
tap
by
some
``
menac
''
bumper
car
-rrb-
.

then
there
were
numer
littl
thing
that
bother
me
.

the
fly
effect
ar
never
convinc
for
a
moment
...
it
's
all
too
obviou
that
helen
slater
is
hook
to
wire
.

instead
of
have
her
look
like
she
's
fly
,
the
filmmak
want
her
to
be
``
grace
''
,
so
she
pose
a
lot
and
doe
ballet-type
maneuv
.

also
,
who
ar
the
first
two
human
to
meet
supergirl
when
she
arriv
on
earth
?

a
pair
of
truck
driver/rapist
who
immedi
attack
her
and
then
meet
a
``
wacki
''
demis
.

there
is
also
some
rampant
product
placement
in
the
film
,
most
notabl
for
popey
's
,
tylenol
,
and
a&w
root
beer
,
with
the
latter
actual
put
it

-rrb-

final
,
just
on

:

fay

the

a
step
in

in

bosco
seem
to
be
an

in
all
thing
supergirl
and
is
there
with
szwarc
to
ensur
that
there
's
no

bosco
probe
szwarc
for

everyth
that
come
onscreen
,
and
we
learn
a
great
deal
more
about

as
a

although
,
at
time
you
can
tell
that

is
look
for
a
specif
respons
from
szwarc
,
and
is
surpris
when
he
doe
n't
get
that
respons
.

we
learn
some
fascin
tidbit
on
the
track
,
most
notabl
the
``
almost

appear
in
the
film
by
christoph
reev
.

is
given
about
superman
's
propos
role
in
the
origin
script
befor
reev
-lrb-
wise
-rrb-
drop
out
.

as
it
stand
,
superman
is
written
off
earli
on
in
the
film
when
we
hear
a
radio
broadcast
mention
that
he
is
billion
of
light
year
awai
on
some
sort
of
peac
mission
.

for
the
sake
of

i

also
reveal
that
is

the

of

-rrb-
that

that

again
,
for

two
featur
the

the

the

and
the

is

but
fan
of
the
film
wo
n't
care
.

on
question
though
...
should
n't
the
director
's
commentari
be
on
the
director
's
cut
of
the
film
?

i
'd
never
seen
supergirl
befor
i
sat
down
to
watch
thi
dvd
.

i
wa
nine
when
it
wa
releas
to
theater
,
and
even
then
i
wa
smart
enough
to
inform
my
parent
not
to
take
me
to
see
it
.

so
when
i
pop
the
dvd
into
my
player
and
sat
down
in
my
easi
chair
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
.

i
knew
the
film
wa
n't
belov
and
i
never
had
ani
interest
in
it
befor
,
but
i
wa
will
to
give
it
a
shot
becaus
of
the
impress
amount
of
work
put
into
the
disc
.

as
the
disc
began
to
spin
i
wa
rather
impress
with
the
open
sequenc
,
which
made
me
sit
up
and
wonder
if
my
assumpt
all
thi
time
could
have
been
wrong
.

come
to
find
out
howev
it
wa
just
the
chase
digit
stereo
logo
...
so
i
slunk
back
into
my
seat
as
the
nightmar
start
.

at
the
end
of
the
film
,
supergirl
fli
back
into
the
lake
with
the
omegahedron
,
and
fli
back
to
argo
citi
.

ugh
,
i
give
up
.

i
'm
surpris
i
even
made
it
to
the
end
of
the
film
not
onc
,
not
twice
,
but
three
time
to
review
these
disc
.

supergirl
is
definit
a
terrif
dvd
packag
,
but
a
veri
lousi
movi
.
