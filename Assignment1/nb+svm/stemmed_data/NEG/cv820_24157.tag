`
the
skull
'
is
a
laughabl
bad
thriller
,
a
teen-orient
doppelgang
of
`
the
firm
'
so
blazingli
ridicul
that
it
caus
me
to
drift
into
a
hypnot
stupor
.

certain
moment
ar
so
preposter
that
i
nearli
herniat
myself
in
an
attempt
to
stifl
laughter
.

i
chuckl
incessantli
,
all
the
wai
home
.

let
me
share
.

the
skull
is
a
secret
societi
conceiv
insid
the
wall
of
yale
-lrb-
design
,
i
'm
sure
,
to
mirror
the
actual
skull
&
bone
from
the
same
colleg
-rrb-
.

luke
mcnamara
-lrb-
joshua
jackson
-rrb-
,
a
towni
and
local
varsiti
row
championship
victor
for
the
third
consecut
year
,
highlight
the
latest
skull
scout
report
.

despit
some
anxieti
and
caution
from
other
,
luke
accept
entri
into
the
organ
.

soon
after
,
he
find
himself
surround
by
beauti
women
,
drive
a
new
car
and
marvel
at
the
$
20
,
000
that
somehow
surfac
in
hi
bank
account
.

yeah
,
dude
,
pretti
good
deal
eh
?

but
luke
soon
learn
that
the
membership
is
somewhat
suffoc
;
when
circumst
becom
extrem
,
there
is
no
wai
he
can
leav
the
societi-except
mayb
as
a
drool
veget
.

the
premis
,
although
lack
in
origin
,
certainli
offer
it
share
of
potenti
intrigu
and
suspens
.

unfortun
,
`
the
skull
'
is
neither
intrigu
,
nor
suspens
,
nor
anyth
els
you
would
associ
with
fresh
or
excit
.

it
's
just
anoth
abysm
teen
prototyp
that
ha
the
soundtrack
,
the
star
...
.

but
not
the
script
.

`
the
skull
'
is
so
bad
it
attain
a
certain
level
of
entertain
valu
,
with
the
screenplai
,
by
jon
pogu
,
immedi
becom
the
basi
for
a
slew
of
unintent
howler
.

first
off
,
upon
their
initi
into
the
skull
,
each
new
member
ha
to
have
a
skull
brand
onto
their
arm
.

afterward
thei
ar
suppli
with
a
wristwatch
that
conveni
cover
up
the
scar
.

will
thei
never
take
thi
watch
off
?

and
what
if
thei
forget
it
by
their
bedsid
?

perhap
their
secret
'
societi
wa
be
a
littl
too
conspicu
when
thei
decid
to
brand
new
member
like
cattl
on
an
area
of
the
bodi
that
is
easili
expos
.

on
top
of
thi
,
thei
ar
each
given
a
rulebook
and
a
kei
to
headquart
.

gee
,
why
not
member
t-shirt
?

but
my
favorit
bit
is
thi
:
the
vote
committe
for
the
skull
doe
not
bother
with
individu
agre
'
or
disagre
'
notion
when
make
collect
decis
.

thei
ar
given
offici
skull
paddl
.

when
flip
to
on
side
,
thei
indic
the
member
agre
with
the
propos
.

face
the
opposit
wai
mean
a
disagr
.

would
n't
thei
mere
express
themselv
verbal
?

hell
no
.

thei
have
to
retriev
the
paddl
for
a
proper
vote
,
and
mayb
afterward
thei
can
plai
ping-pong
.

i
'm
still
chuckl
about
these
ludicr
detail
,
but
the
humili
dialogu
is
enough
to
send
on
into
arrest
.

the
cast
,
meanwhil
,
combin
a
pinch
of
veteran
talent
with
a
dash
of
the
`
dawson
's
creek
'
crowd
,
and
fuse
the
two
togeth
,
ensur
that
the
embarrass
will
be
a
mutual
share
union
throughout
.

but
not
entir
.

accomplish

like
craig

and
then
there
's
christoph
mcdonald
,
who
ha
the
capac
to
be
a
fun
,
excit
actor
.

mcdonald
's
charisma
is

i
prai
it

a

'
exercis
for
all
these
actor

the
young
troup
of

let
's
cut
the
talent
canadian
lad
joshua
jackson
some
slack
for
maintain
believ
within
the
confin
of
hi
charact
.

paul
walker
,
the
strap
quarterback
from
`
varsiti
blue
'
,
is
bland
but
passabl
as
caleb
mandrak-the
judg

son

walker
preserv
a
straight
face
,
even
when
dealt

silliest

in

movi
-lrb-
`
dad
,
i
just
kill
a
gui
in

'
-rrb-
.

some
actual
spark
is
gener
by
lesli
bibb
,
who
plai
luke
's
longtim
chum
chloe
,
and
manag
to
successfulli
pull
off
some
convinc

it
realli
boil
down
to
the
actor
attempt
to
punctur
the
surround
plastic
bubbl
of
absurd
that
cage
them
from
minut
on

or
mayb
not
minut
on
,
thank
to
a
decent
set-up
from
director
rob
cohen
,
who
film
earli
sequenc
with
a
sens
of
atmospher
and
style
.

it
make
you
wonder
why
he
did
n't
flee
indefinit
from
the
project
,
becaus
while
enjoy
chees
like
`
dragonheart
'
and
the
moder
stallon
thriller
`
daylight
'
ar
n't
superior
cinema
,
thei
belong
on
the
afi
top
100
list
when
compar
to
thi
degrad
trash
.

asid
from
unintention
humor
the
audienc

`
the

get
littl
accomplish

the
thrill
and
action
ar
lazi

mechan

the
stori
is
stuf
with
ridicul
,
formula
plot
that
sheepishli
overlook
the
cool
potenti
of
a
secret
underground
societi
flick
.

instead
of
gain
knowledg
about
the
skull
as
an

,
we
ar
thrust

a
lame

surveil
conspiraci
that
ha

barnacl

we
've
seen
it
all
befor

and
better
.

`
the
skull
'
is
a
feebl
littl
circu
of
stupid
,
so
miscalcul
that
--
while
it
would
serv
as
a
clever
pun

a
term
like
bonehead

seem
just
too
gener
