``
the
beach
''
is
a
structur
confus
film
that
i
can
onli
describ
ha
have
multipl
person
disord
.

everi
forti
minut
of
thi
two-hour
film
begin
with
a
new
theme
,
virtual
discard
what
ha
been
set
up
in
the
preced
act
.

it
start
off
purposefulli
as
a
film
about
an
innoc
man
seek
new
thrill
in
a
danger
environ
.

but
then
in
the
second
act
,
the
mood
of
the
film
abruptli
chang
and
it
becom
a
stori
about
a
love
triangl
on
an
idyl
island
paradis
that
evok
vision
of
``
blue
lagoon
''
.

forti
minut
later
,
the
mood
chang
onc
more
,
and
it
becom
a
dumb
down
version
of
``
lord
of
the
fli
''
where
an
isol
commun
is
discov
,
where
their
moral
code
tout
maintain
a
sens
of
bliss
at
all
cost
.

by
the
time
it
's
over
,
you
can
onli
scratch
your
head
and
wonder
what
thi
film
wa
realli
meant
to
be
about
.

the
main
charact
of
``
the
beach
''
is
angst-ridden
richard
-lrb-
leonardo
dicaprio
-rrb-
.

he
travel
to
the
netherworld
of
bangkok
where
back
allei
merchant
push
their
ware
upon
unsuspect
tourist
and
scantili
clad
women
brazenli
ask
if
you
're
look
for
a
good
time
.

richard
's
voic-over
tell
the
audienc
that
he
ha
come
to
thi
place
becaus
he
is
bore
with
hi
life
and
feel
that
on
wai
to
reinvigor
himself
is
to
let
go
of
the
familiar
and
to
enter
into
a
world
of
the
unknown
.

thi
seedi
environ
is
just
what
richard
is
look
for
.

he
check
into
a
fleabag
hotel
where
he
meet
the
craze
daffi
-lrb-
robert
carlisl
-rrb-
.

he
seem
like
a
rave
lunat
,
obvious
high
from
heavi
drug
us
and
look
as
if
he
is
afflict
with
some
sort
of
psychosi
.

though
hi
jag
behavior
would
distress
most
of
us
,
richard
listen
to
him
as
he
speak
of
a
mysteri
island
that
contain
the
most
perfect
beach
that
anyon
ha
ever
seen
.

moreov
,
the
island
itself
flourish
with
enough
hemp
plant
that
can
make
a
small
citi
high
for
life
.

captiv
by
the
idea
,
he
ask
two
other
hotel
guest
to
join
him
on
hi
journei
.

thei
ar
worldli
etienn
and
the
allur
francois
,
who
have
also
come
to
thailand
for
reason
similar
to
richard
's
.

onc
thei
final
arriv
at
thi
paradis
,
howev
,
the
mood
of
the
stori
shift
to
richard
's
grow
desir
for
francois
.

thi
particular
plot
point
is
weak
at
best
becaus
there
is
absolut
no
question
in
my
mind
that
francois
will
wind
up
with
richard
.

etienn
is
about
as
excit
as
fluffi
,
white
sand
.

it
's
odd
that
etienn
never
see
thi
come
,
but
paradis
ha
a
wai
of
hide
potenti
threat
just
out
of
view
.

and
onc
the
three
stumbl
across
the
hidden
commun
-lrb-
mood
shift
immin
-rrb-
,
more
event
transpir
that
depict
it
hidden
danger
.

for
exampl
,
there
ar
marijuana
field
close
by
patrol
by
arm
guard
.

and
the
lagoon
in
which
thei
swim
invit
the
occasion
shark
.

there
ar
sever
idea
that
ar
introduc
in
``
the
beach
''
and
each
on
could
merit
it
own
featur-length
film
.

there
's
the
man
vs.
natur
angl
,
the
love
triangl
angl
,
and
the
utopia-gone-awri
angl
.

but
the
film
meander
so
tremend
that
it
entir
purpos
becom
blur
.

dicaprio
,
as
a
result
,
ha
an
almost
imposs
time
of
try
to
embodi
the
differ
state
of
mind
that
he
and
the
film
goe
through
.

consequ
,
the
audienc
ha
an
equal
difficult
time
try
to
keep
up
.
