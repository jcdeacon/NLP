mayb
thi
mission
should
have
been
scrub
there
's
a
world
of
differ
between
artist
and
technician
.

the
artist
ha
a
vision
to
creat
someth
new
.

he
mai
not
do
it
well
,
it
might
be
sloppi
,
but
it
's
someth
you
've
never
seen
befor
.

a
good
technician
can
make
it
look
good
,
but
without
direct
from
hi
own
inner
artist
or
someon
els
,
it
's
go
to
be
just
a
xerox
.

obvious
success
film
need
both
skill
.

brian
de
palma
is
a
master
technician
.

he
's
spent
hi
career
copi
other
,
most
notabl
hitchcock
.

he
usual
know
exactli
what
to
do
to
make
a
scene
work
,
but
onli
becaus
he
ha
learn
it
by
rote
.

asid
from
rare
flash
of
origin
,
hi
film
ar
often
soul-dead
.

in
de
palma
's
latest
,
he
turn
hi
attent
to
stanlei
kubrick
.

to
tell
the
truth
,
i
enjoi
portion
of
thi
movi
,
but
i
like
it
a
lot
better
over
30
year
ago
when
it
wa
call
``
2001
''
.

i
enjoi
it
even
more
when
it
wa
titl
``
close
encount
''
.

nasa
ha
set
it
sight
for
mar
.

when
the
first
crew
meet
with
disast
,
a
rescu
mission
is
sent
to
the
red
planet
.

thei
do
n't
do
so
well
either
,
but
eventu
meet
up
the
lone
surviv
astronaut-gone-rasta
and
solv
the
mysteri
of
the
univers
.

and
it
's
all
so
bore
.

there
ar
so
mani
scene
that
just
do
n't
work
,
it
's
difficult
to
begin
.

when
the
first
crew
is
a
few
feet
awai
from
a
rage
massiv
upsid-down
martian
tornado
-lrb-
which
look
remark
like
a
sandworm
from
``
dune
''
-rrb-
destroi
everyth
in
it
path
,
thei
just
hang
out
watch
.

error
.

the
most
interest
charact
-lrb-
and
that
's
not
sai
much
-rrb-
is
kill
off
.

error
.

the
alien
is
laughabl
.

error
.

the
rest
of
the
charact
ar
the
dullest
peopl
imagin
.

error
.

there
's
some
nice
eyecandi
.

the
face
on
mar
,
which
turn
out
to
be
a
giant
metal
thai
buddha
head
,
look
cool
.

a
three-dimension
holograph
planetarium
is
more
fun
to
watch
than
anyth
at
disnei
world
.

maneuv
in
space
suit
outsid
the
ship
seem
realist
.

but
there
's
so
much
more
that
feel
as
if
we
've
been
there
befor
.

from
``
2001
''
,
there
's
the
rotat
space
station
,
the
blind
white
room
.

from
``

,
thei
solv
a
sound
puzzl
and
plai
it
to
the
alien

the
list
goe
on

the

even
gari

ca
n't
muster
enough
emot
to

no
on
seem
to
care
about
anyth
that
happen
.

you
wo
n't
either
.

the
absolut
worst
sin
is
the
blatant
product
placement
as
dr.
pepper

with
a
20
foot
