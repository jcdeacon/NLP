the
onli
two
realli
good
thing
that
i
can
sai
about
tarzan
and
the
lost
citi
ar
as
follow
:
jane
march
wa
veri
cute
as
jane
,
and
the
movi
wa
thankfulli
underminut
in
length
.

if
you
have
n't
alreadi
figur
it
out
,
i
did
n't
like
thi
movi
veri
much
.

the
plot
wa
bore
and
contriv
to
the
extrem
.

tarzan
-lrb-
casper
van
dien
-rrb-
ha
now
left
the
jungl
and
live
in
civil
societi
.

he
is
just
dai
awai
from
hi
impend
marriag
to
jane
,
plai
by
the
aptli
name
jane
march
.

back
in
hi
former
home
of
africa
,
a
group
of
looter
ha
found
the
kei
to
locat
a
lost
citi
.

-lrb-
mind
you
i
never
realli
figur
out
why
thei
actual
want
to
find
thi
citi
.
-rrb-

anywai
,
tarzan
's
old
jungl
friend
appear
to
him
in
a
vision
.

tarzan
realiz
that
he
must
return
to
africa
to
help
stop
the
bad
gui
from
find
the
lost
citi
.

he
leav
jane
-lrb-
hi
first
mistak
,
in
my
opinion
-rrb-
and
travel
to
africa
.

of
cours
,
jane
is
hot
on
her
ap
man
's
heal
.

the
two
of
them
ar
reunit
in
africa
where
thei
do
battl
with
the
bad
gui
.

sound
like
a
dumb
explan
of
the
plot
?

it
's
actual
an
improv
over
the
real
thing
.

the
act
is
just
plain
aw
.

i
'm
not
quit
sure
what
casper
van
dien
wa
do
in
thi
film
,
but
it
wa
n't
act
.

jane
march
wa
n't
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
,
but
at
least
she
is
easi
on
the
ey
.

compound
the
bad
act
wa
the
fact
that
in
mani
place
the
dialogu
had
obvious
been
re-record
,
and
i
've
seen
better
dub
in
some
old
bruce
lee
movi
.

ad
to
the
sound
problem
wa
the
cinematographi
.

thi
film
wa
fill
with
beauti
african
sceneri
.

but
the
panoram
sceneri
shot
look
overexpos
to
me
.

quit
frankli
,
i
think
you
could
probabl
do
a
better
job
captur
the
beauti
of
africa
with
a
camcord
than
thi
bunch
did
with
profession
film
equip
.

then
we
have
the
special
effect
.

``
special
effect
in
a
tarzan
movi
?
''

you
ar
no
doubt
ask
yourself
?

ye
friend
,
the
writer
inject
some
veri
out
of
place
supernatur
element
into
the
stori
.

probabl
for
the
sake
of
us
cgi
,
sinc
it
did
noth
but
hurt
the
stori
.

in
most
part
,
thei
were
n't
bad
,
just
noth
special
.

but
,
thei
were
more
than
a
littl
on
the
hokei
side
.

except
of
cours
,
when
we
got
to
the
ridicul
climax
of
thi
movi
.

the
grand
final
's
special
effect
went
right
into
the
toilet
at
that
point
.

it
almost
look
like
thei
had
run
out
of
monei
.

these
effect
were
of
notic
lower
qualiti
than
those
in
the
rest
of
the
film
and
look
like
someth
in
an
amateur
video
product
.

i
took
on
lesson
awai
from
watch
tarzan
and
the
lost
citi
--
ap
men
and
bone
that
morph
into
skelet
warrior
do
n't
mix
.

stai
far
awai
from
thi
version
of
tarzan
.
