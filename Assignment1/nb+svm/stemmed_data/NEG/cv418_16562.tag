the
taglin
for

is
,
``

and
sure
enough
,
thi
is
true
,
as

no

there
ar
no

who
made

it

tellingli
,
he

the
origin

of
the
film
,
but
wa
cast
when
extens
reshoot
took
place
month
later
-rrb-
.

like
most
action
movi
,
the
star
often
take
a
lick
but
keep
on
tick
.

in
the
cours
of
the
102-minut
run
time
of
``
payback
,
''
porter
is
shot
three
time
in
the
back
,
hit
by
a
van
,
beaten
up
,
and
ha
hi
feet
smash
with
a
sledgehamm
.

and
guess
what
?

not
onli
doe
he
surviv
the
whole
ordeal
,
but
he
is
happi-go-lucki
in
the
penultim
sequenc
-lrb-
and
can
still
walk
!
-rrb-

,
even
though
he
look
like
he
had
recent
substitut
for
a
punch
bag
.

``
payback
''
is
not
,
in
ani
wai
,
an
entertain
film
,
even
though
i
am
sure
the
maker
hope
it
would
be
with
all
the
graphic
carnag
that
goe
on
,
but
take
awai
that
violenc
and
what
you
ar
basic
left
with
is
a
blank
screen
.

perhap
director
helgeland
would
have
been
smart
to
consid
thi
,
so
he
could
have
at
least
ad
a
few
worthwhil
element
,
like
a
fresh
storylin
and
charact
whom
you
could
even
remot
stand
to
be
around
for
a
few
hour
.
