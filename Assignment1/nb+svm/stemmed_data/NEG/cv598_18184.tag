everi
now
and
then
,
review
ar
face
with
the
film
that
ar
hard
to
be
properli
review
.

most
of
the
time
it
happen
with
film
that
leav
so
overwhelm
impact
,
either
good
or
bad
,
that
in
the
end
review
must
work
hard
to
express
hi
thought
or
feel
.

but
,
sometim
it
can
happen
for
rather
trivial
reason
.

i
love
troubl
happen
to
be
on
of
such
occas
for
the
author
of
thi
review
.

the
impress
left
by
the
film
wa
n't
overwhelm-on
the
contrari
,
there
were
hardli
ani
impress
at
all
,
sinc
i
had
real
troubl
keep
myself
awak
while
watch
it
.

which
surpris
me
to
thi
dai
,
becaus
the
movi
theatr
wa
full
,
i
wa
close
to
sound
speaker
,
the
show
wa
n't
late
and
i
did
n't
lack
sleep
befor
the
show
.

such
thing
happen
veri
rare
to
me
,
and
,
after
mani
year
,
the
closest
thing
to
solut
to
thi
mysteri
is
probabl
the
qualiti
of
the
film
itself
.

the
plot
revolv
around
two
rival
chicago
report-old
peter
brackett
-lrb-
nick
nolt
-rrb-
and
young
,
aspir
sabrina
peterson
-lrb-
julia
robert
-rrb-
.

two
of
them
ar
assign
to
cover
the
train
collis
.

as
soon
as
thei
meet
,
thei
start
scoop
each
other
,
but
dure
the
process
thei
both
discov
sinist
plot
involv
cancerogen
milk
,
and
also
the
romant
feel
thei
have
for
each
other
.

the
plot
in
thi
film
is
rather
secondari
to
it
real
raison
d'tre-romant
pair
reminisc
of
classic
screwbal
comedi
star
spencer
traci
and
katharin
hepburn
.

movi
author
,
director
and
screenwrit
charl
shyer
,
who
had
some
experi
with
turn
the
screwbal
spirit
into
modern
set
with
father
of
the
bride
,
tri
again
,
thi
time
pair
old
nick
nolt
with
young
julia
robert
.

howev
,
although
there
is
some
chemistri
between
the
two
,
soon
it
stop
to
arous
ani
interest
.

it
probabl
happen
due
to
poorli
execut
genr
mix
,
that
collid
light-heart
romant
comedi
with
rather
uninterest
plot
suitabl
to
pure
action
thriller
.

shyer
as
director
fail
to
make
the
proper
transit
between
the
two
,
and
fail
in
both
area
,
make
the
stori
clich
and
predict
.

the
end
result
is
rather
forgett
effort
,
which
convinc
me
not
to
watch
movi
again
.

i
'll
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
though
.
