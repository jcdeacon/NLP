comment
:
why
is
thi
movi
call
possess
by
the
night
?

it
's
hard
to
specul
.

most
of
thi
film
take
place
dure
the
dai
,
and
the
onli
thing
possess
anyon
is
an
icki
,
pulsat
,
bubbl
brain
thingi
in
a
jar
.

in
case
you
have
n't
pick
up
on
thi
yet
,
possess
by
the
night
is
a
bottom-of-the-barrel
``
thriller
''
-lrb-
i
us
the
term
``
thriller
''
loos
here
-rrb-
which
is
realli
cheap
and
bad
.

the
plot
,
which
sound
like
a
cheesi
pulp
scienc
fiction
stori
from
the
1950s
,
actual
serv
on
purpos
:
to
exploit
nude
women
as
often
as
possibl
.

write
a
movi
review
for
a
film
like
thi
prove
oddli
challeng
.

there
's
realli
not
much
to
sai
.

the
act
is
lousi
;
although
,
occasion
,
the
attempt
at
act
ar
so
absurd
that
thei
garner
a
chuckl
or
two
from
the
audienc
.

most
humor
is
frank
sivero
,
who
plai
murrai
,
the
novelist
's
agent
.

he
is
so
horribl
in
thi
role
that
on
ca
n't
help
but
be
amus
.

the
plot
suck
.

nearli
half
the
film
is
devot
to
a
loser
loan
shark
who
want
out
of
the
profess
,
even
though
he
ha
onli
limit
relev
to
the
movi
as
a
whole
.

the
dialogu
stink
.

a
loan
shark
,
for
instanc
,
tell
anoth
how
much
he
love
bimbo
,
which
is
someth
the
audienc
realli
doe
n't
need
to
know
.

everyth
about
possess
by
the
night
is
second
rate
,
even
the
film
credit
.

as
the
name
of
the
not-so-talent
film
crew
scroll
by
at
the
end
,
joseph
scale
came
up
,
credit
as
be
``
assists
to
folei
artist
.
''

someon
could
have
us
an
editor
!

to
be
honest
,
the
film
is
basic
an
excus
to
flash
frontal
nuditi
and
show
some
sex
scene
.

playboi
playmat
shannon
tweed
,
after
all
,
is
the
star
here
.

i
suppos
that
if
on
want
thi
sort
of
thing
,
he
would
like
thi
movi
.

why
did
i
give
thi
turkeystarsand
not
on
?

as
a
bad
movi
,
it
is
unintention
funni
enough
to
keep
someon
passingli
interest
in
the
film
.

if
you
feel
possess
to
see
possess
by
the
night
,
howev
,
i
'd
recommend
you
exorcis
thi
impuls
and
watch
someth
els
.
