of

97
-rrb-
who
's
in
a
massachusett
jail
,
but
who
ha
appar
seen
the
jackal
,
who
ha
been
elud
the
law
forev
.

soon
,
he
's
out
work
with
the
two
untrust
agent
,
and
try
to
help
them
catch
him
.

there
ar
numer
problem
with
the
film
,
and
which
on
is
the
biggest
on
is
pretti
imposs
to
put
a
finger
on
.

the
film
is
suppos
to
be
a
big
suspens
thriller
,
but
save
a
coupl
moment
,
the
film
never
achiev
suspens
,
or
even
a
sens
of
intrigu
.

sure
,
the
big
assasin
attempt
is
a
bit
cool
look
and
even
slightli
tens
,
but
everi
other
scene
in
the
film
is
too
short
and
too
dull
to
regist
.

the
film
never
pick
up
enough
to
becom
a
thrill
experi
,
or
even
an
entertain
on
.

it
doe
n't
help
that
the
plot
is
design
to
be
complex
,
but
fall
into
so
mani
problem
,
like
plot
hole
and
unbeliev
circumst
.

the
script
of
``
the
jackal
''
is
a
complet
mess
,
mostli
becaus
it
ca
n't
decid
what
it
want
to
focu
on
.

is
thi
a
film
about
a
man
try
to
find
redempt
by
catch
a
nasti
killer
?

is
it
a
film
about
a
nasti
,
amor
hitman
who
's
in
everyth
for
the
monei
?

or
is
it
a
combin
of
both
?

``
the
jackal
''
aim
for
the
latter
,
but
never
focus
in
on
either
charact
.

the
connect
between
the
two
feel
complet
edit
,
so
much
that
in
a
scene
when
the
jackal
turn
around
and
notic
declan
,
you
wonder
how
he
recogn
him
so
fast
.

the
worst
part
is
the
littl
past
thei
try
to
give
declan
,
most
notabl
hi
relationship
with
an
old
girlfriend
,
isabella
-lrb-
mathilda
mai
-rrb-
,
given
so
littl
screen
time
that
you
almost
forget
her
charact
exist
until
she
pop
up
everi
now
and
then
.

the
support
charact
ar
wors
.

sidnei
poitier
is
given
a
complet
unplay
role
,
that
of
a
man
who
is
just
stern
sometim
,
and
other
time
more
give
and
likabl
.

what
is
poitier
do
here
?

he
's
on
of
the
best
live
actor
!

doe
he
realli
need
to
wast
hi
time
do
drivel
like
thi
?

dian
venora
's
russian
charact
is
almost
as
bad
,
with
a
cigarett
perpetu
in
her
mouth
,
and
a
plaster
on
expressionless
facad
.

it
's
not
that
anyon
's
bad
here
;
it
's
that
thei
have
noth
to
do
.

the
plot
is
a
joke
,
feel
like
it
wa
past
togeth
by
someon
in
post-product
who
drop
each
scene
on
the
floor
and
past
them
togeth
quickli
so
it
could
be
releas
on
time
.

the
jackal
himself
is
not
even
much
of
an
intern
villain
.

there
ar
sever
time
where
he
's
in
a
tight
situat
and
make
thing
wors
for
himself
,
the
onli
explan
be
that
the
filmmak
want
to
toss
in
a
cheap
thrill
.

take
a
scene
where
he
's
be
follow
by
some
agent
into
a
park
garag
:
he
quickli
sprai
hi
car
anoth
color
,
and
add
a
solvent
that
if
touch
kill
the
person
who
touch
it
.

doe
n't
kill
someon
attract
more
attent
than
it
doe
distract
?

and
doe
he
think
dy
hi
hair
bottl
blond
make
him
fit
in
in
a
public
place
?

geez
!

is
there
anyth
good
here
?

well
...
a
coupl
thing
.

i
did
like
willi
's
ici
express
;
he
mai
not
have
been
real
suav
or
anyth
,
but
some
of
hi
look
ar
worth
a
chuckl
.

richard
gere
ha
a
coupl
of
good
moment
,
make
hi
charact
as
likabl
as
he
possibl
could
have
.

and
a
coupl
sequenc
ar
kicki
in
that
kind
of
proposter
,
complet
inan
but
fun
kinda
wai
,
most
notabl
:
a
sequenc
where
he
test
out
a
new
gun
on
an
annoi
gun
builder
-lrb-
jack
black
-rrb-
;
and
a
bit
where
he
seduc
a
gai
washington
man
,
which
ha
it
share
of
a
coupl
good
joke
,
most
particular
a
kiss
by
willi
.

but
none
of
these
elev
the
film
ani
higher
than
it
could
go
;
thei
're
just
littl
distract
along
the
wai
to
amus
us
mildli
then
toss
us
back
into
the
world
of
dull
and
stupid
that
is
``
the
jackal
.
''

director
michael
caton-jone
-lrb-
who
direct
the
far
superior
``
rob

-rrb-
ha
made
a
film
that
is
made
veri
coupl
month
,
on
that
is
unentertain
,
unintrigu
,
and
pretti
much
cold
,
but
will
nevertheless
make
monei
becaus
,
hei
,
the
trailer
do
make
it
look
like
it
mai
be
fun
in
that
kind
of
retro-clanci
kinda
wai
.

everi
now
and
then
,
the
filmmak
get
it
right
-lrb-
``
clear
and
present
danger
,
''
which
wa
enorm
fun
in
that
smart
kinda
wai
-rrb-
,
but
``
the
jackal
''
is
an
exampl
of
when
thei
go
complet
wrong
.

in
short
,
it
's
a
mess
.

period
