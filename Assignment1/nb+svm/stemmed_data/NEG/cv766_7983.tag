in-no

of
gilligan

somehow
make
it
wai
into
a
multimillion
dollar
blockbust
product
.

joel
schumach
's
direct
of
batman
and
robin
is
horrif
,
with
a
terribl
balanc
of
flashi
over
substanc
.

there
is
a
clear
conceit
toward
neon
in
thi
film
,
even
moreso
than
with
hi
previou
batman

,
with
the

that

headquart
of

five
minut
of

involv
an
incred
uninvolv
late-night
motorcycl
race
with
barbara
and
some
gotham
goon
.

mr.
schumach
's
focu
for
batman
and
robin
appear
to
be
to
make
the
film
as
visual
strike
as
possibl
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
stori-there
ar
drastic
shift
in
the
tone
of
the
film
between
all-out
camp
and
heartfelt
drama
,
with
the
latter
complet
unconvinc
and
ineffect
.

it
is
perhap
not
the
most
promis
of
sign
when
the
group
i
wa
with
burst
out
laugh
within
twenti
second
of
the
film
's
open
,
even
befor
a
singl
line
of
dialogu
had
been
utter
.

is
batman
and
robin
suppos
to
be
campi
?

i
think
it
is-it
's
hard
to
imagin
that
the
filmmak
could
have
intend
mani
part
of
the
film
to
be
taken
at
all
serious
.

-rrb-

is
it
suppos
to
be
as
overli
campi
as
it
turn
out
to
be
?

i
somehow
doubt
it-the
subplot
involv
afr
is
deliv
so
solemnli
and
with
such
grave
that
the
impress
is
made
that
the
film
is
n't
attempt
to
be
the
utter
farc
which
it
is
.

arnold
schwarzenegg
is
top-bill
in
the
film
as
the
villain
mr.
freez
,
and
is
bland
and
uninterest
,
perhap
the
worst
thing
that
a
villain
can
be
.

mr.
schwarzenegg
's
attempt
to
be

laughabl
,
and
hi
attempt

ar
laughabl

frankli
,
everyth

by

,
i
wa

a

the

of

georg
