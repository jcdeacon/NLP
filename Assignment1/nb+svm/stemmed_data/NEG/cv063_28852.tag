it

asid

zinger
-lrb-
yeah

-rrb-

,
america
's
sweetheart
'
joke
ar
n't
funni
,
it
pace
is
choppi
,
and
the
whole
affair
come
off
as
a
vaniti
project
--
not
for
headlin
star
julia
robert
--
but
for
billi
crystal
to
deliv
a
bunch
of
lame
punch
line
that
he
wrote
himself
.

i
did
n't
time
it
-lrb-
the
movi
's
not
that
bad
-rrb-
,
but
it
's
crystal
who
realli
ha
the
most
screen
time
and
is
the
unequivoc
focu
of
the
film
.

bad
move
,
billi
--
your
joke
suck
.

the
crotch
humor
is
outpac
onli
by
the
mean
of
the
movi
's
gag
--
and
with
unsubtl
sexual
innuendo
drip
from
everi
scene
,
how
thi
movi
earn
a
pg-13
rate
is
a
mysteri
to
me
.

julia
overcam
a
lot
of
spite
write
and
act
to
make
my
best
friend
's
wed
into
a
win
film
,
but
not
even
that
90-tooth
smile
can
save
her
here
.

obvious
awar
of
the
ugli
befor
him
,
director
joe
roth
turn
to
goofi
support
charact
like
hank
azaria
-lrb-
as
a
lisp
spaniard
-rrb-
,
christoph
walken
-lrb-
the
insan
time
over
time
director
-rrb-
,
and
alan
arkin
-lrb-
a
new
ag
guru
in
a
fright
wig
-rrb-
to
crack
wise
.

none
of
the
stereotyp
is
success
except
for
walken
;
azaria
come
off
as
a
preen
queen
when
he
's
suppos
to
be
macho
.

as
for
roth
,
in
case
you
do
n't
know
,
went
from
direc
reveng
of
the
nerd
ii
to
launch
hi
own
movi
studio
,
revolut
,
which
produc
thi
work
.

he
's
back
behind
the
camera
for
the
first
time
inyear
.

it
'll
probabl
be
anotherbefor
he
's
back
again
.

i
could
drone
on
about
how
america
's
sweetheart
will
onli
appeal
to
the
mouth-breath
moron
who
talk
on
their
cell
phone
dure
the
movi
,
but
that
would
get
old
.

instead
,
i
'll
settl
for
discuss
the
movi
's
worst
sin
:
that
sweetheart
is
painfulli
contriv
and
wholli
unbeliev
,
not
just
in
it
plot
but
in
it
sentiment
.

everi
singl
charact
in
thi
film
-lrb-
with
the
arguabl
except
of
kiki
-rrb-
is
simpli
hate
,
and
put
them
in
a
romant
comedi
is
a
wast
of
a
bunch
of
villain
.

when
you
leav
the
theater
,
you
'll
ask
yourself
,
too
:
why
would
i
want
ani
of
these
jerk
to
be
happi
?
