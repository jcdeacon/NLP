there
ar
scene
in
``
the
big
hit
''
that
ar
so
aw
,
thei
simpli
defi
descript
.

the
movi
is
infect
with
the
same
kind
of
blunderhead
idioci
and
misplac
confid
that
made
``
last
action
hero
''
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
such
a
chore
to
sit
through
.

presum
,
``
the
big
hit
''
is
an
action-comedi
,
a
difficult
but
not
imposs
genr
to
pull
off
.

movi
of
thi
sort
requir
a
fine
balanc
and
care
tone
,
and
the
comedi
is
usual
meant
to
work
as
catharsi
for
the
violenc
.

``
lethal
weapon
2
''
-lrb-
1989
-rrb-
is
a
perfect
exampl
of
an
action
thriller
that
wa
also
veri
,
veri
funni
.

unfortun
,
in
``
the
big
hit
,
''
it
seem
that
comedi
is
the
main
motiv
,
and
the
violenc
is
onli
intend
to
punctuat
the
laugh
.

unfortun
,
there
ar
no
laugh
.

the
movi
resembl
some
of
the

but
it
doe
n't
benefit
from

mani
of

can
be
trace

what

just
a

the

almost
off

which
can

describ
