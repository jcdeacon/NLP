and
then
no

will
ever
have
to
hear
from
it
again
.

thi

festiv
2001
's
emerg
master
seri
is
easili
on
of
the
year
's
worst
.

bill
as
a

`
bonni

clyde

,
thi
gritti
film
from
director
marcelo
pieyro
ha
it
onli
highlight
in
a
well-design
titl
sequenc
.

two
gai
lover
get
involv
in
a
bank
robberi
that
make
a
gang
leader
,
whose
plan
thei
screw
up

thi
caus
the
gang

to
send
hi

out
to
get
the

on
of
whom
mai
not

hide
out
in
a
prostitut

apart
,
the
two
men
must
fight
off
polic
and
gang
member
in
a
veri
long
showdown
for
the
movi

if

thei

lose
all
the

and
their

as
an

emot
bonu
,
on
of
the
gai
men
is
dy
.

or
someth
like
that
.

everyth
that
happen
is
so
quick
and
confus
i
wa
complet
lost
.

clariti
is
n't
exactli
thi
movi
's
strive
virtu
,
so
it
wa
a
littl
hard
to
pick
up
.

not
much
could
have
realli
happen
though
.

the
main
event
in
thi
long
two-hour
film
ar
explicit
homosexu
and
heterosexu
sex
,
graphic
drug
us
,
extrem
violenc
,
and
strong
languag
.

lot
of
explicit
materi
is
never
a
bad
thing
when
there
's
a
reason
,
but
there
's
no
purpos
to
anyth
in
thi
film
.

most
of
the
sex
and
violenc
scene
come
off
as
silli
,
while
the
heavi
drug
us
come
off
as
ridicul
and
depress
.

it
appear
pieyro
-lrb-
who
co-wrote
with
marcelo
figuera
,
from
a
novel
by
ricardo
piglia
-rrb-
purposefulli
add
more
blood
and
lovemak
for
hi
own
amus
.

he
make
the
actor
as
sweati
and
dirti
as
possibl
,
make
them
snort
cocain
,
give
them
gun
and
condom
,
and
let
them
go
.

burnt
monei
is
pointless
.

the
perform
ar
bad
.

it
tri
to
thrill
and
shock
,
but
onli
caus
boredom
.

god
forbid
it
will
ever
get
a
distributor
.

anoth
disappoint
film
from
thi
year
's
so-call
emerg
master
seri

pass
on
by
