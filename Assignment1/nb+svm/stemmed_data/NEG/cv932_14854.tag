go
to
be
fire
unless

almost
run
down

``

.

g
wander
onto
the
televis
set
and
connect
with
the
viewer
by
tell
them
that
thei
do
n't
realli
want
all
that
commerci
crap
.

in
some
unexplain
manner
,
thi
caus
sale
to
sour
.

ricki
is
save
.

the
movi
tri
to
be
too
much
at
onc
and
fail
at
it
all
.

it
's
not
an
over-the-top
comedi
or
a
heart-warm
messag
of
human
.

it
_
is
_
a
mish-mosh
of
poorli
direct
scene
made
even
wors
by
insipid
dialog
.

i
am
will
to
put
up
with
preach
from
a
film
,
but
the
messag
here
ar
old
hat
.

you
should
take
time
to
smell
the
rose
.

sell
your
soul
for
cash
is
a
bad
idea
.

golli
.

i
'm
glad
i
saw
the
movi
.

i
never
would
have
thought
of
these
.

the
opportun
to
poke
fun
at
the
goofi
product
is
mostli
miss
.

when
g
take
a
chainsaw
to
the
set
,
there
's
an
obviou
chanc
for
murphi
to
be
hilari
.

it
doe
n't
happen
.

the
bit
ar
so
subdu
and
overli-long
that
there
's
onli
a
hint
of
laughter
from
the
audienc
.

murphi
ha
chang
hi
role
in
recent
year
and
not
for
the
better
.

there
ar
hint
of
promis
in
thi
on
.

the
onli
time
the
film
pick
up
even
a
littl
is
when
hi
shave-head
charact
in
the
long
flow
white
caftan
show
up
on
screen
.

the
other
ar
horrend
.

goldblum
ha
episod
of
brillianc
in
hi
career
,
but
here
he
seem
to
have
been
replac
with
a
lifeless
pod
from
hi
``
invas
of
the
bodi
snatcher
''
.

hi
relationship
with
kate
make
no
sens
.

thei
move
from
antagon
to
love
somewher
off
screen
.

preston
is
as
uninterest
as
she
could
possibl
be
.

somewher
hidden
deep
insid
of
thi
film
is
about
ten
minut
of
valu
.

an
attempt
to
satir
stupid
televis
,
we
get
a
self-parodi
instead
.
