in
the
seri
of
the
erot
thriller
that
flood
the
videoshelv
in
the
earli
1990s
came
thi
french-canadian
co-product
by
max
fischer
.

the
movi
is
set
in
pari
where
it
hero
,
struggl
american
author
david
mirkin

judd
nelson
,
at
the
time
specialis

her
connect

power
david
caravan
-lrb-
pierc
brosnan
-rrb-
would
make
mirkin
step
the
line
between
reason
and
saniti
and
put
in
motion
whole
seri
of
violent
and
tragic
event
.

although
few
pseudoerot
scene
and
some
element
of
the
plot
do
inde
make
thi
film
an
erot
thriller
,
drama
would
probabl
be
more
appropri
genr
label
.

pace
of
the
film
is
simpli
too
slow
to
thrill
the
viewer
,
and
those
patient
enough
to
sit
through
it
entireti
have
to
wait
a
long
time
between
ani
interest
or
signific

.

low

and
physic
attribut
of
laurenc

ar
the
onli
thing
worth
watch
in
thi
film
.

unfortun
,
thi
film
ha
too
littl
of
those
supposedli
erot
scene
,
so
those
who
want
to
watch
erot
thriller
have
all
the
reason
to
feel
disappoint
.

instead
,
thei
would
have
to
settl
with
pointless
,
slow
scene
involv
nelson
,
brosnan
and
laurenc
treill
's
attempt
of
seriou
act
.

all
of
those
definit
not
worth
spend
hour
and
half
of
someon
's
preciou
time
.
