-rrb-
then

and
he
must
of
been
on
some
drug
when
he
wrote
the
final
ten
minut
,
which
ar
aw
.

the
special
effect
look
nice
,
but
do
noth
for
the
film
.

there
's
some
impress
make
up
effect
also
.

the
music
is
also
good
,
which
is
score
by
danni
elfman
.

but
great
effect
and
make
up
do
n't
make
a
great
film
.

scroog
is
an
appal
attempt
to
inject
some
christma
spirit
into
the
audienc
,
see
as
the
firsthourminut
of
the
film
ar
so
depress
anywai
,
and
the
last
ten
minut
had
to
make
up
for
it
with
an
godaw
speech
.

why
did
n't
cross
just
look
out
hi
exec
window
,
and
ask
a
young
boi
to
bui
a
goos
for
him
?

overal
,
then
,
you
'd
have
a
much
better
christma
if
you
avoid
thi
film
like
someth
that
should
be
