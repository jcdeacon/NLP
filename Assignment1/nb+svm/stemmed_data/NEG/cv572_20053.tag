in
frighten
us
with
hi
grotesqu
portrait
of
the
`
real
world
'
,
he
forgot

everyth
about
the
movi
becom
dull
and
lifeless
,
repel
the

like
the
effect
of
bug
sprai
to
insect
.

although

is
a
total
bust
,
leav
intrigu
audienc
in
a
baffl
state
of
extrem
disappoint
as
the
proceed
spiral
out
of
control
.

cage
is
the

's
sole
flame
of
energi
.

hi
perform
is
actual
believ
,
but
soon
the
director
's
demand
start
to
weigh
heavili
on
hi
shoulder
and
he
begin
stumbl

still
,
you
've
got
to
give
him
credit
for
hold
thi
project
togeth
as
long
as
he
did
,
for
that
is
no
easi
feat
when
you
consid
the
problem
at
hand
.

well

trail
soon
lead
him
to
a
bizarr
filmmak
-lrb-
plai
convincingli
by
peter
stormar

who
is

thi
is
where

the
edg
into
a
serial
killer-like
phase
,
in
which
he
must
take
reveng
on
all

,
and
thei
have
a
bloodi
brawl
in

,
a
fight
sequenc
that
would
look

at
home
in
a
schwarzenegg
movi
.

walker
,
8mm
dissip
into
a
poor
man
's
seven
,
with
all
the
violenc
but
littl
of
the
effect
that
made
the
latter
such
a
chill
masterpiec
.

furthermor
,
what
ha
becom
of
joel
schumach
?

the
director
ha
recent
experienc
a
major
drought
,
slum
in
the
depth
of
dismal
flop
after
flop
-lrb-
batman
and
robin
,
anyon
?
-rrb-
.

thi
putrid
thriller
is
certainli
not
go
to
reviv
hi
career
,
so
perhap
schumach
should
start
explor
hi
lighter
side
.
