what
a
mess
.

i
have
no
problem
when
film
refus
to
be
constrict
by
the
linear
of
time
--
pulp
fiction
,
which
twist
time
everi
which
wai
,
wa
a
masterpiec
--
but
i
do
take
except
to
movi
that
decid
to
plai
around
with
it
for
no
reason
other
than
to
confus
the
viewer
.

the
limei
doe
exactli
that
.

the
plot
is
permeat
with
flashback
,
flash-forward
and
what
can
onli
be
describ
as
random
time-travel
,
without
ani
evid
purpos
.

there
is
no
method
to
thi
movi
's
mad
.

it
us
a
fanci
wai
to
tell
a
stori
that
would
be
better
off
told
more
convention
and
more
comprehend
.

the
plot
is
n't
particularli
interest
in
the
first
place
:
tradit
,
mildli
hacknei
and
not
veri
involv
.

thi
is
a
sort
of
brood
film
--
our
protagonist
doe
n't
speak
much
and
the
action
sequenc
ar
done
with
an
annoyingli
perfunctori
attitud
.

i
felt
like
the
director
wa
n't
veri
interest
in
the
proceed
himself
,
almost
like
he
made
thi
film
for
a
paycheck
.

ditto
for
the
edit
,
which
seem
to
be
deliber
sloppi
and
unpleas
.

sixti
icon
terrenc
stamp
manag
to
at
least
be
menac
as
the
ag
crimin
.

he
's
not
much
in
the
wai
of
statur
but
he
ha
a
surprisingli
impos
physic
presenc
that
work
to
hi
advantag
here
.

peter
fonda
is
an
unbeliev
underr
actor
:
he
's
shy
,
quiet
but
alwai
effect
.

he
's
adept
at
convei
emot
through
speech
rather
than
express
:
hi
feel
do
n't
alwai
show
on
hi
face
by
you
can
alwai
tell
what
thei
ar
.

thi
is
basic
a
convent
thriller
told
in
a
pretenti
bizarr
fashion
.

why
soderbergh
could
n't
just
parrot
down
and
tell
a
stori
,
i
do
n't
know
,
but
what
he
doe
do
certainli
doe
n't
work
.

the
result
is
a
wild
cornucopia
of
imag
that
amount
to
precis
nil
--
even
the
action
scene
do
n't
work
.

1999
mai
have
signifi
the
death
of
the
tradit
act
on-act
two-act
three
storylin
,
but
obvious
some
movi
have
not
yet
transcend
it
.

shall
we
go
back
to
basic
?
