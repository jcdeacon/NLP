wick
wife
in
``
bride
of
chucki
,
''
and
their
unholi
matrimoni
is
someth
old
,
noth
new
.

the
burn
question
on
the
mind
of
most
moviego
,
howev
,
ha
noth
to
do
with
nuptial
specif
or
even
how
the
movi
stack
up
,
but
rather
whether
or
not
the
duo
get
down
and
dirti
on
their
blood-soak
honeymoon
.

the
answer
is
a
sick-and-twist
ye-and
viewer
ar
treat
to
a
shadowi
glimps
of
some
hot-enough-to-melt-rubber
-lrb-
or
at
least

guess
thei
're
anatom
correct
.

chucki

of
the
``

seri
,
a
my
buddi-type
doll

by
the
spirit
of
a

.

in

''
-rrb-
with
the
help
of
a
black

''

silli
mortal
.

befor
long
,
she
's
also
been
reduc
to
shin-high
figurin
statu
,
and
the
plastic
incarn
of
these
on-time
lunat
lovebird
hit
the
road
to
scope
out
some
potenti
new
human
bodi
.

the
rest
of
thi
rocki
horror
puppet
show
plai
out
as
tiff
and
the
chuckster
stalk
a
young
coupl
-lrb-
nick

-rrb-
with
conjug
plan
of
their

,
lead
them
toward
a
new
jersei
grave
where
a

along
the

our
murder

go
through
post-marriag
motion
similar
to
ani
given
pair
of
newlyw-bicker
,
argu

kiss
and
make

.

but
when
thei
squabbl
over
who
's
go
to
do
the
dish
,
watch
out
.

hei
,
even
faux
peopl
have
got
to
work
through
their
problem
.

director
ronni
yu
keep
the
mayhem
flashi
and
stage
an
invent
scene
or
two
,
but
not
even
visual
flair
can
make
up
for
the
fact
that
these
creepi
kewpi
ar
neither
scari
nor
menac
.

when
on
of
them
charg
,
it
's
noth
a
good
forward
punt
could
n't
take
care
of
.

and
when
a
climact

is
need
,
on

so
the

throw
in
some
silli
casualti
and
a
ridicul
end
-lrb-
will
``
son

be
next
?
-rrb-

and
thi
is
a
bizarr
bad
89-minut
at
the
movi
.

as
is
the
thing
to
do
in
post
-
``
scream
''
slasher
cinema
,
don
mancini
's
screenplai
slather
on
the
in-joke
and
genr-parodi
.

but
littl
of
the
humor
succe
,
prove
self-refer
can
be
complet
worthless
when
it
lack
bite
.

to
be
fair
,
though
,
most
of
``
bride
of
chucki
''
is
on
auto-pilot
,
so
it
's
not
quit
right
to
singl
out
on
misfir
aspect
of
the
film
.

similarli
shaki
,
the
act
rang
from
screech
camp
to
bore
bland
,
the
effect
ar
n't
that
special
and
the
stori
is
on
big
groaner
.

here
's
hope
chucki
and
hi
entir
clan-past
,
present
and
futur-rest
in
