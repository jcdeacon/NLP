sylvest
stallon
ha
made
some
crap
film
in
hi
lifetim
,
but
thi
ha
got
to
be
on
of
the
worst
.

a
total
dull
stori
that
think
it
can
us
variou
explos
to
make
it
interest
,
``
the
specialist
''
is
about
as
excit
as
an
episod
of
``
dragnet
,
''
and
about
as
well
act
.

even
some
attempt
at
film
noir
mood
ar
destroi
by
a
sappi
script
,
stupid
and
unlik
charact
,
and
just
plain
nothing
.

who
knew
a
big
explos
could
be
so
bore
and
anti-climact
?

unless
you
saw
``
blown
awai
''
...
``
the
specliast
''
of
the
titl
is
none
other
than
action
star
sylvest
stallon
-lrb-
in
comeback
#
19
,
i
think
-rrb-
,
who
plai
a
quiet
,
hermit-like
bomber
who
wa
onc
a
bomb
expert
with
the
armi
or
someth
,
but
who
suffer
a
chang
of
heart
when
he
and
hi
assist
-lrb-
jame
wood
,
who
show
us
exactli
what
over-the-top
is
,
other
than
anoth
bad
sly
film
-rrb-
accident
kill
some
innoc
peopl
dure
a
job
.

hi
credo
is
kill
bad
peopl
,
not
innoc
.

and
that
's
why
he
make
big
bomb
.

so
anywai
,
into
hi
life
step
the
seduct
sharon
stone
,
who
is
basic
the
girlfriend/moll
of
the
stupid
son
-lrb-
eric
robert
-rrb-
of
a
cuban/miami
kingpin
-lrb-
rod
steiger
,
in
an
indecipher
accent
,
which
is
sometim
cuban
,
sometim
brando
,
sometim
scottish
,
etc
-rrb-
.

turn
out
sharon
is
actual
us
her
boyfriend
so
she
can
kill
him
,
sinc
he
kill
her
parent
when
she
wa
young
.

so
she
call
sly
,
leav
messag
with
him
,
send
him
e-mail
,
etc
,
about
plant
a
bomb
to
kill
robert
,
which
sly
listen
to
obsess
,
and
while
he
work
out
nake
.

yea
.

also
into
hi
life
,
though
again
,
come
wood
,
who
ha
been
tip
off
by
stone
to
catch
sly
.

us
the
cop
,
he
tri
to
set
up
trap
,
none
which
realli
work
,
so
when
sly
call
him
,
he
goe
ballisit
on
hi
ass
over
the
phone
,
get
so
work
up
by
sai
hi
must-be-improvis
speech
that
he
seem
to
pop
the
vein
in
hi
head
wide
open
.

these
ar
the
most
excit
scene
in
the
film
,
and
wood
becom
the
onli
ounc
of
entertain
in
the
film
.

the
film
tri
to
offer
us
a
moodi
film
noir
,
except
with
explos
,
but
come
up
complet
snake-ey
.

it
's
just
a
pretend
film
noir
,
make
it
a
big
wast
of
time
.

and
for
action
buff
,
the
action
scene
ar
pretti
lame
,
with
some
realli
unrealist-look
special
effect
-lrb-
a
penthous
be
blown
off
of
a
hotel
look
like
a
piec
of
cardboard
fall
into
a
tub
-rrb-
.

then
there
's
the
much-discuss
sex
scene
between
sly
and
stone
,
which
ar
about
as
mispair
a
coupl
as
rachel
and
ross
on
``
friend
.
''

their
sex
scene
is
more
nauseat
then
sexi
,
becaus
it
show
us
more
of
sly
than
stone
.

now
let
's
guess
who
we
'd
rather
see
nake
,
okai
?

stone
's
small
but
perki
breast
,
which
we
've
seen
more
time
than
harvei
keitel
's
dick
,
or
stallon
's
veini
ass
,
which
is
n't
usual
shown
for
a
veri
good
reason
?

i
know
i
ca
n't
realli
judg
it
as
a
flaw
of
the
film
,
but
come
on
.

the
worst
flaw
of
the
film
is
thi
:
it
's
bore
.

i
mean
,
i
wa
on
caffein
when
watch
it
,
but
my
friend
fell
asleep
onli
to
be
woken
up
by
jame
wood
rant
.

but
a
good
movi
doe
not
jame
wood
go
nut
make
.

if
you
're
in
for
some
fun
action
,
rent
sly
's
earlier
``
demolit
man
,
''
which
suck
too
,
but
in
a
much
more
entertain
fashion
.

skip
thi
dull
film
,
unless
you
want
to
see
wood
,
or
make
fun
of
steiger
's
accent
,
or
see
stone
's
breast
again
.
