wyatt
earp
detail
thirti-five
year
in
the
life
of
same
from
around
1865
to
1900
.

after
see
the
movi
speed
twice
recent
,
i
kept
think
that
i
wa
see
wyatt
's
life
pass
befor
my
ey
in
real
time
.

thi
movi
wa
bore
,
slow
,
bore
,
and
slow
.

there
were
a
few
scene
that
tri
to
be
great
scene
that
tri
too
hard
and
just
fell
flat
.

the
script
happili
woman-bash
but
also
tri
to
sound
like
an
80s
movi
.

thei
can
not
have
it
both
wai
.

``
i
now
pronounc
you
husband
and
wife
.
''

sure
,
thei
said
that
in
the
1800s
.

``
entrepreneur
.
''

sure
.

everi
bit
of
male-ego-stroke
dialogu
that
wyatt
's
third
wife
speak
to
him
made
me
sick
to
listen
to
it
.

``
oh
,
the
script
wa
written
by
two
men
?
''

``
no
kid
!
''

the
movi
is
tortur
to
sit
through
.

the
sceneri
is
bore
.

the
fade
were
either
awkward
or
clich
or
to
self
import
.

can
you
sai
poor
edit
?

everyon
look
ugli
in
thi
movi
.

when
you
shoot
peopl
from
under
their
chin
,
thei
look
like
thei
have
doubl
chin
.

kevin
costner
ha
never
look
wors
.

he
should
sue
.

he
look
like
he
gain
thepound
that
denni
quaid

of
a
small
role
as

.

annabeth
gish

as
wyatt
's
first
wife

%
of
thi
movi
