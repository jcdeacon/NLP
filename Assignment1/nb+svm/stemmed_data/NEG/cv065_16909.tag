movi
review
have
an
oblig
to
see
the
good
,
the
bad
,
and
the
despic
.

i
origin
wrote
thi
review
for
my
colleg
newspap
back
in
'
95
,
but
i
want
to
re-write
it
becaus
not
all
retro
review
should
be
about
the
classic
.

we
need
to
be
warn
about
some
truli
aw
film
,
too
.

thi
pictur
wa
so
bad
,
it
inspir
the
descript
for
my
rate
-lrb-
see
rate
chart
below
-rrb-
.

the
onli
thing
save
it
from
a
rate
is
that
be
abl
to
rent
a
movi
like
thi
is
slightli
less
embarass
than
rent
a
porno
.

so
,
it
doe
inde
have
some
pluss
...
in
fair
,
elizabeth
berklei
is
certainli
worth
see
in
the
buff
.

and
her
abil
to
whine
and
irrit
us
,
even
while
nude
,
wa
appropri
in
her
role
as
selfish
temptress
nomi
malon
.

thi
charact
is
not
smart
,
not
interest
,
and
-lrb-
deliber
?
-rrb-

far
too
annoi
far
too
often
.

like
in
1998s
``
bulworth
''
,
when
the
movi
wa
over
i
did
n't
care
on
littl
iota
about
the
main
charact
.

at
least
warren
beatti
tri
to
make
a
statement
with
hi
dreari
and
overr
film
,
though
.

``
showgirl
''
is
too
stupid
to
make
a
statement
.

some
peopl
claim
that
the
stori
is
base
on
the
legendari
``
all
about
ev
''
of
all
thing
!

if
exploit
expert
joe
eszterha
wa
half
the
screenwrit
that
joseph
l.
mankiewicz
wa
,
he
'd
be
...
well
,
he
'd
be
a
good
screenwrit
.

instead
,
thi
project
mai
have
sunk
hi
career
.

he
wrote
the
-lrb-
ha
ha
!
-rrb-

script
and
the
usual
reliabl
paul
verhoeven
direct
.

the
same
team
who
creat
a
good
sex-film
in
1992
-lrb-
``
basic
instinct
''
-rrb-
struck
out
here
with
their
occasion
violenc
,
gratuit
x-rate
sex
scene
,
and
numer
-lrb-
and
quit
unnecessari
-rrb-
lesbian
overton
.

the
predict
storylin
revolv
around
nomi
streak
into
la
vega
to
make
it
big
as
a
dancer
.

after
the
suppos
street-smart
young
``
ladi
''
get
con
out
of
her
suitcas
by
a
slack-jaw
yokel
in
the
open
sequenc
,
she
befriend
a
tailor
of
the
glamor
stage
product
at
the
``
stardust
hotel
''
.

nomi
doe
n't
take
advantag
of
thi
contact
to
break
into
the
big-time
of
dirti
danc
right
awai
.

first
,
she
becom
a
lap
dancer
at
a
scummi
strip
club
.

she
sell
her
hot
littl
ware
at
``
the
cheetah
''
for
a
short
time
,
turn
on
the
fictiti
custom
and
the
actual
theatr
audienc
.

hei
,
i
never
said
she
wa
n't
a
hot
number
...
mayb
it
's
that
,
her
bodi
,
which
get
her
into
the
big-time
when
the
star
of
the
``
stardust
hotel
''
,
crystal
connor
-lrb-
gina
gershon
-rrb-
stop
into
the
strip
club
-lrb-
it
certainli
is
n't
her
brain
or
pleasant
disposit
!
-rrb-
.

crystal
request
a
privat
lap
danc
for
her
boyfriend
-lrb-
kyle
maclachlan
-rrb-
.

he
also
happen
to
be
the
pleasur-seek
worm
who
run
the
big
show
.

crystal
get
nomi
onto
the
``
stardust
''
team
and
,
after
an
intermin
amount
of
time
,
nomi
``
earn
''
the
role
of
crystal
's
understudi
.

the
slut
then
deliber
injur
and
hospit
crystal
.

it
wa
almost
laughabl
that
nomi
had
the
gut
to
claim
that
she
's
``
not
a
whore
''
.

that
's
a
phrase
we
hear
a
few
differ
time
and
it
's
complet
ludicr
.

of
cours
she
is
!

she
sell
her
soul
to
make
it
big
,
but
in
the
end
we
're
suppos
to
believ
that
she
's
a
better
person
than
that
.

we
're
suppos
to
root
for
her
.

no
wai
!

she
's
a
tramp
and
a
back-stabber
who
deserv
noth
--
least
of
all
vindic
in
the
...
ahem
...
climax
.

she
is
not
a
good
person
and
thei
take
over
two
hour
to
explain
that
the
audienc
should
think
that
she
is
.

the
sub-plot
with
a
male
dancer
-lrb-
glenn
plummer
-rrb-
who
claim
to
see
talent
in
nomi
is
just
a
gratuit
opportun
to
let
her
danc
nake
a
littl
bit
more
.

it
sure
ai
n't
charact
develop
!

plummer
also
appear
in
``
speed
''
in
'94
in
a
smaller
,
yet
better
role
.

thi
sub-plot
goe
absolut
nowher
except
mayb
to
deliv
an
unsubtl
hint
that
fornic
should
practic
birth
control
.

kyle
maclachlan
must
have
been
promis
a
big
pai-dai
or
hi
standard
have
dip
sinc
appear
in
``
blue
velvet
''
.

that
pictur
wa
weird
,
but
some
critic
claim
it
's
on
of
the
best
movi
of
the
'80s
.

now
ol'
kyle
can
sai
that
he
act
in
on
of
the
worst
of
the
'90s
,
too
.

hi
sleazi
charact
is
import
to
``
showgirl
''
,
but
we
do
n't
learn
anyth
about
him
.

he
us
peopl
to
get
what
he
want
,
but
that
onli
mean
that
he
fit
in
well
with
the
other
charact
in
thi
movi
.

is
he
a
villain
?

who
care
!

ultim
,
thi
movi
is
as
tiresom
as
it
is
explicit
.

everyon
must
know
by
now
about
the
soft-core
act
of
copul
,
especi
the
riotou
romp
between
berklei
and
maclachlan
in
hi
pool
.

what
few
review
take
issu
with
is
how
mean-spirit
thi
movi
is
.

everyon
's
either
have
sex
,
exact
reveng
,
or
wish
thei
were
have
sex
or
exact
reveng
.

it
's
just
too
hard
to
take
-lrb-
especi
for
over
two
hour
-rrb-
.

if
we
must
be
expos
to
the
evil
of
the
vega
world
,
why
could
n't
verhoeven
have
also
made
a
point
of
highlight
the
whisper
,
grunt
,
and
other
sound
dure
the
danc
number
?

it
's
hard
to
care
about
these
peopl
if
we
ca
n't
even
appreci
what
thei
're
capabl
of
do
on-stage
.

berklei
mai
have
a
futur
in
hollywood
becaus
she
can
danc
and
she
ha
a
great
bodi
.

after
all
,
the
world
of
porn
is
still
an
activ
,
dishonour
profess
.

perhap
berklei
could
join
their
rank
and
leav
the
real
act
to
pauli
shore
and
cindi
crawford
.

oop
,
thei
're
bad
actor
,
too
.

well
,
at
least
,
thei
're
not
selfish
and
contempt
like
good
ol'
slutti
nomi
malon
.
