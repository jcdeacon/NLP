thi
is
an
adapt
of
h.
g.
well
'
acclaim
novel
`
the
invis
man
'
.

the
actor
ar
kevin
beacon
and
elizabeth
shue
.

the
director
is
paul
verhoven
.

that
,
plu
a
quick
demonstr
of
the
amaz
special
effect
in
the
trailer
,
should
be
enough
to
lure
us
into
the
theatr
.

the
problem
is
to
keep
us
there
.

i
ca
n't
imagin
anyon
who
would
like
to
see
thi
movi
a
second
time
.

work
on
a
top
secret

project
,
sebastian
cain
-lrb-
kevin
beacon
-rrb-
--
an
eccentr
geniu
,
that
call
himself
``
god
''
,
ha
discov
the
secret
to
invis
.

the
first
two
face
ar
complet
.

now
,
it
is
time
for
``
the
next
logic
step
''
--
human
.

cain
volunt
for
thi
riski
experi
.

but
when
he
is
made
invis
,
someth
goe
wrong
.

while
hi
ex-girlfriend
linda
-lrb-
elisabeth
shue
-rrb-
desper
tri
to
find
someth
to
return
him
to
normal
,
he
learn
that
invis
is
more
of
a
prison
than
a
superpow
.

but
that
's
not
the
bad
thing
--
an
unexpect
side-effect
of
the
drug
send
him
careen
into
paranoid
megalomania
.

he
is
natur
given
a
coupl
of
modest
superpow
,
just
enough
for
him
to
surviv
immol
from
a
flame
thrower
and
an
explos
of
about
a
quart
of
nitroglycerin
.

soon
everi
sens
of
decenc
is
forgotten
.

the
littl
intellig
that
wa
left
disappear
as
verhoven
loos
control
and
the
film
turn
into
an
alien-rip-off
,
where
cain
is
walk
like
a
half
finish
termin
,
spook
,
scare
and
kill
everybodi
.

though
it
's
base
on
a
novel
call
`
the
invis
man
'
,
the
titl
ha
been
iron
chang
to
`
hollow
man
'
that
sum
up
the
film
veri
nice
.

thi
is
a
veri
silli
product
.

laughabl
,
actual
.

appar
verhoven
's
imagin
doe
n't
stretch
too
far
.

for
him
the
onli
worthwhil
reason
to
becom
invis
is
so
you
can
case
the
girl
'
locker
room
undetect
.

it
is
thi
primit
schoolboi
mental
that
eventu
kill
the
movi
.

be
invis
,
give
you
the
opportun
to
be
who
you
ar
,
to
do
what
you
want
without
be
influenc
by
societi
.

in
mani
wai
it
give
you
an
illus
of
have
a
life
without
consequ
.

the
natur
of
man
and
hi
place
in
societi
is
what
the
novel
is
truli
about
.

all
that
,
the
depth
and
true
horror
of
the
book
is
gone
and
onli
special
effect
make
you
remain
in
your
seat
.

cain
doe
us
hi
power
voyeurist
in
hollow
man
.

but
sinc
thi
is
a
modern
,
in
other
word
a
dehuman
,
he
doe
n't
stop
there
.

he
becom
a
rapist
.

and
then
,
of
cours
,
a
murder
.

you
'll
start
wonder
why
such
actor
as
beacon
and
shue
found
themselv
in
such
film
in
the
first
place
.

shue
's
talent
is
bare
seen
,
josh
brolin
is
underus
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
suffer
mostli
for
the
lack
of
talent
.

kevin
beacon
is
the
onli
on
that
perform
gracefulli
.

hi
face
is
not
seen
for
the
most
part
of
the
film
,
and
the
onli
wai
he
exist
is
as
a
disembodi
voic
.

there
ar
time
when
hi
presenc
actual
save
the
film
from
be
complet
embarrass
.

in
the
end
the
effect
ar
the
onli
reason
to
see
thi
film
in
the
first
place
.

be
probabl
the
best
technic
achiev
sinc
``
jurass
park
''
,
thei
ar
absolut
amaz
.

we
observ
the
layer
of
skin
,
muscl
,
tissu
,
and
bone
be
peel
awai
as
a
bodi
is
slowli
render
invis
.

we
see
a
beat
heart
,
inflat
lung
,
and
vein
puls
with
newli-pump
blood
.

there
ar
a
coupl
of
invent
shot
with
smoke
,
fire
,
air
and
water
,
but
ar
a
few
scene
like
that
worth
attend
a
movi
for
?

what
is
truli
disturb
is
that
with
a
great
book
,
talent
actor
and
a
grand
budget
,
thi
could
have
been
so
much
more
.

pretti
much
like
jan
de
bont
-lrb-
``
twister
''
,
``
haunt
''
-rrb-
,
paul
verhoven
ha
never
made
anyth
extraordinari
.

he
wa
respons
for
sever
good
film
-lrb-
``
basic
instinct
''
and
``
starship
trooper
-rrb-
''
and
some
incred
bad
film
-lrb-
``
showgirl
''
,
``
total
recal
''
-rrb-
,
but
he
ha
never
made
anyth
that
wa
great
.

in
a
wai
``
hollow
man
''
fit
perfectli
in
thi
collect
.

it
's
not
better
or
wors
than
verhoven
's
averag
film
.

he
prove
onc
again
that
he
is
incap
of
handl
more
complex
issu
.

and
so
,
instead
of
depth
and
chill
,
verhoven
insert
some
of
hi
trademark
:
stupid
dialogu
,
and
lot
's
of
dull
action
with
blood
and
nake
bodi
.

he
even
throw
in
some
of
the
worst
of
film
clich-the
slowli
advanc
firebal
,
the
villain
who
come
back
from
the
dead
,
etc
,
etc.-and
top
the
whole
thing
off
with
on
of
the
most
ridicul
end
of
the
year
-lrb-
you
'll
be
scream
``
nooooo
!
''

and
attempt
to
run
toward
the
exit
in
slow
motion
-rrb-
.

and
all
we
can
ask
is
why
?

the
answer
is
simpl
.

though
hollywood
is
a
movi
produc
machin
,
the
busi
of
moviemak
ha
to
be
about
someth
more
than
monei
.

it
ha
to
be
about
tell
stori
,
not
market
them
.

it
ha
to
be
about
transport
us
to
a
differ
place
,
to
dazzl
us
with
magic
and
clever
.

to
make
us
care
,
to
make
us
think
and
feel
.

verhoven
ha
obvious
miss
that
point
and
thi
film
is
a
proof
of
that
.

it
's
all
flesh
and
bone
,
but
no
soul
.

a
void
where
it
imagin
should
be
.
