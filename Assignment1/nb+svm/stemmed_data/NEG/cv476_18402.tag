200
cigarett
a
backdrop
of
new
year
's
ev
in
1981
would
seem
to
lend
itself
to
a
great
parti
movi
.

the
decor
possibl
ar
endless-disco
ball
had
yet
to
migrat
into
the
dark
corner
of
the
attic
,
big
hair
wa
worth
it
weight
in
aquanet
,
and
the
louder
the
fashion
,
the
better
the
look
.

but
despit
thi
set
,
these
detail
and
a
soundtrack
that
includ
some
40-plu
irresist
hit
from
the
earli
dai
of
the
me
decad
,
someth
is
inher
wrong
with
``
200
cigarett
.
''

a
better
titl
for
thi
nostalg
mess
would
be
``
50
miss
opportun
.
''

what
is
it
that
make
thi
retro-comedi
such
a
downer
?

it
's
certainli
not
the
cast
,
which
includ
enough
hot
,
young
talent
for
sever
movi
.

there
's
courtnei

cement
her
reput
as
a
seriou
actress
;
christina

,
hot

her
shoulda-been-nomin
turn
in
``

''
;
paul
rudd
,
who
get
even
more
appeal
with
everi
role
;
kate

,
inherit
some
fine
act
gene
from
mom
goldi
hawn
;
and
affleck
brother
ben
and
casei
,
two
of
the
best
thing
about
``
good
will
hunt
.
''

perhap
the
question
is
thi
:
what
drew
these
and
other
immens
talent
actor
to
such
a
dreari
project
?

mayb
it
