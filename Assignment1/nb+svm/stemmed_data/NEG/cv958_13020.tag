typic
of

and
there
's
realli
not
much
style

director
andrew
davi
-lrb-
the
accomplish
wit
and
best-forgotten
other
film
-rrb-
ha
made
exactli
the
wrong
choic
at
almost
everi
turn
.

dougla
and
paltrow
have
both
shown
us
that
thei
ar
skill

in
previou
film

mortensen
show
promis
in
the
past
.

here
all
three
ar
walk
uninterestingli
through
their
role
with
oddli
waxen
face
.

the
onli
person
who
show
ani
sens
of
life
is
david
suchet
as
new
york
detect
moham
karaman
.

he
's
onli
on-screen
long
enough
to
make
you
think
that
there
might
be
a
likabl
person
in
the
film
and
then
he
disappear
.

the
first
concern
of
a
suspens
film
is
to
creat
suspens
.

surpris
ar
import
.

in
thi
movi
the
audienc
keep
wait
for
someth
to
happen
.

and
noth
ever
doe
.

nearli
everi
event
is
telegraph
in
advanc
.

close-up
on
thi
object
or
that
action
and
it
's
easi
to
guess
what
's
go
to
happen
.

as
the
film
plod
toward
it
inevit
conclus
you
keep
expect
a
plot
twist
to
make
the
movi
worthwhil
.

it
's
a
hopeless
quest
.

the
stori
doe
n't
make
much
sens
.

steven
's
wife
is
load
.

even
with
unfriendli
relat
,
you
'd
think
that
he
could
have
talk
to
her
about
hi
difficulti
rather
than
decid
to
kill
her
.

when
he
doe
decid
on
the
dire
plan
he
make
an
unreason
choic
.

if
you
were
go
to
hire
someon
to
kill
your
wife
,
would
your
first
choic
be
her
lover
?

no
matter
how
sleazi
he
is
,
i
would
think
there
might
be
a
chanc
that
he
would
turn
down
the
opportun
.

why
would
steven
plan
the
murder
as
a
break-in
in
their
apart
?

why
not
just
take
her
out
as
she
wa
walk
to
david
's
loft
in
a
bad
neighborhood
?

while
decid
among
the
numer
summer
film
,
you
might
do
well
to
skip
thi
on
.

you
'll
find
more
suspens
than
thi
movi
offer
by
watch
the
weather
channel
.
