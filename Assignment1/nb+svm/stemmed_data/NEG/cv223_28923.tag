the
first
imag
in
``
final
fantasi
:
the
spirit
within
''
is
a
comput-anim
close-up
of
a
human
ey
.

it
's
a
beauti
piec
of
work
,
remark
detail
and
quit
convinc
.

when
the
pictur
pull
back
to
reveal
the
owner
of
the
ey
,
howev
,
thing
chang
.

the
young
woman
ha
mesmer
hair
,
although
it
hang
too
artfulli
even
by
movi
standard
to
be
believ
.

the
facial
featur
ar
more
detail
than
ani
comput-anim
seen
to
date
,
but
the
result
is
more
reminisc
of
a
veri
well-craft
doll
than
anyth
human
.

she
is
pretti
,
but
bland
,
and
not
nearli
express
enough
to
come
off
like
a
person
.

all
the
charact
in
``
final
fantasi
''
ar
like
that
.

of
the
core
group
,
the
younger
white
men
and
women
ar
all
athlet
,
attract
and
indistinct
,
like
applic
for
a
tv
realiti
show
.

the
black
man
is
taller
and
burlier
,
and
the
ag
scholar
is
bald
,
with
wrinkl
and
a
beard
.

none
of
them
appear
to
be
base
on
individu
;
thei
all
look
like
the
product
of
gener
descript
given
a
polic
sketch
artist
.

it
get
wors
when
thei
talk
and
move
.

why
is
the
sarcast
voic
of
steve
buscemi
,
he
of
the
great
twist
face
and
snaggleteeth
,
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
some
dreari
ken
doll
?

why
,
for
everi
fluid
physic
gestur
,
do
we
also
see
herki-jerki
puppet-style
motion
?

more
to
the
point
,
who
decid
a
full-length
comput
anim
movi
featur
``
hyperr
''
-lrb-
their
term
,
not
mine
-rrb-
humanoid
wa
a
good
idea
?

``
final
fantasi
''
is
base
on
a
phenomen
popular
video
game
i
've
never
plai
,
with
a
stori
straight
out
of
japanes
anim
,
which
more
often
than
not
leav
me
bore
and
depress
.

if
you
're
a
fan
of
either
,
pleas
spare
me
your
letter
,
as
i
will
focu
sole
on
the
finish
film
and
not
it
sourc
materi
.

with
an
express-challeng
cast
,
``
final

''
mix
turgid
action
scene
with
heap
of
mystic
shit
.

the
result
is
ugli
,
confus
and
bore
.

note
:
the
follow
reveal
the
basic
plot
.

if
you
want
to
have
a
fight
chanc
of

ani
sens
of
the
movi
,
i
suggest
you
read
it

earth
is
at

the

so
there
you
have
it
.

like
most
of
the
anim
i
've
seen
,
the

combin
apocalypt
set
,
lot
of
shoot

fuzzi

,
all
wrap
up
in
a
save-the-earth
bow

but
i
'm
bore
with
apocalypt
set
.

i
understand
why
so
mani
live-action
film
emploi
them
thei
're
cheap
but
anim
film
can
show
anyth
,
so
why
wallow
in
an
industri
trash
heap
?

the
action
scene
and
shoot-em-up
do
n't
satisfi
either
.

the
human
move
oddli
and
their
facial
featur
ar
so
mute
that
the

ca
n't

their

aki
is

disappoint
;
with
her
lack
of
express
and
flat
deliveri
,
she
look
and
sound
like
a
brunet

of

the
eloi

from
