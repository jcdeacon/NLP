so
much
for

.

but
who
would
want
to
catch
a
giant
snake
with
a
fish
pole
?

our
villain
saron
show
hi
soft
side
when
he
stop
terri
from
shoot
the
snake
.

too
bad
that
anaconda
is
just
about
to
strangl
anoth
member
of
the
expedit
.

on
by
on
she
goe
after
the
other
.

eric
stoltz
is
stung
by
a
giant
wasp
right
in
the
begin
and
is
mercifulli
unconci
for
the
rest
of
the
adventur
.

the
rest
of
the
crew
keep
entertain
the
viewer
although
not
the
wai
the
maker
of
the
movi
had
plan
.

howev
the
scene
without
the
anaconda
ar
rather
bore
.

whenev
the
lead
ladi
show
up
we
're
in
for
a
laugh
.

the
snake
remind
us
of
a
favorit
charact
of
a
famou
anim
movi
even
if
she
should
be
an
aw-inspir
monster
.

her
attack
alwai
follow
the
same
plan
:
on
last
hypnot
look-she
's
look
at
you
,
kid-then
she
speedili
wrap
herself
around
her
victim
and
start
to
gush
it
down
.

mostli
we
do
n't
see
the
act
of
devour
.

but
she
look
nice
when
she
wiggl
awai
with
her
bulg
middl
part
.

whoever
did
the
special
effect
on
thi
movi
mai
have
want
to
go
to
a
zoo
first
and
studi
some
real
snake
.

mayb
then
the
anaconda
model
would
have
look
more
real
.

the
animatron
ar
somewhat
more
believ
.

but
that
did
n't
work
for
the
strangl
scene
.

do
n't
go
see
the
movi
for
the
f/x
.

thei
ar
everyth
but
up-to-date
.

the
viewer
who
like
to
watch
the
end
credit
will
see
to
hi/her
surpris
that
a
snake
expert
wa
a
consult
for
the
team
.

we
mai
doubt
though
that
he
ha
ever
seen
the
final
result
of
hi
work
.

a
well
known
american
scienc
magazin
is
also
mention
in
the
credit
,
but
i
will
refrain
from
name
it
here
to
avoid
further
damag
to
it
reput
.

the
major
of
viewer
will
have
left
the
theater
as
soon
as
the
credit
start
roll
,
anywai
.

what
kind
of
audienc
is
the
target
group
for
thi
movi
?

hard
to
sai
.

thi
ca
n't
be
a
seriou
horror
movi
,
or
can
it
?

see
for
yourself
.
