-RRB-
Renown
surrealist
director
,
the
77-year-old
Frenchman
Alain
Resnais
-LRB-
Hiroshima
,
Mon
Amour/Last
Year
at
Marienbad/M
élo
-RRB-
,
has
created
a
lighthearted
musical
played
as
an
homage
to
Britisher
Dennis
Potter
and
his
Pennies
from
Heaven
-LRB-
1978
TV
serial
,
1981
movie
-RRB-
and
The
Singing
Detective
-LRB-
1986
-RRB-
.

The
film
follows
Potter
's
gimmicky
style
of
having
the
characters
jump
into
lip-synched
old
or
contemporary
French
pop
songs
to
express
their
private
thoughts
.

He
also
follows
the
kind
of
sweet
and
colorful
musicals
his
fellow
countryman
Jacques
Demy
loved
to
direct
,
such
as
``
The
Umbrellas
of
Cherbourg
''
and
``
The
Young
Girls
of
Rochefort
.
''

The
tale
has
Resnais
's
unique
touches
as
a
director
to
go
along
with
his
homage
.

It
is
a
satire
about
class
differences
and
falling
in
love
with
the
wrong
person
,
and
that
there
is
a
song
in
everyone
's
heart
for
every
occasion
.

What
hinders
this
production
is
that
the
stars
are
not
portraying
particularly
engaging
characters
,
the
songs
are
not
memorable
and
stand
little
chance
of
being
recognized
by
an
American
audience
-LRB-
the
exceptions
might
be
the
Edith
Piaf
and
Maurice
Chevalier
numbers
-RRB-
,
and
the
farce
seems
more
banal
than
daring
.

Yet
it
is
not
without
its
striking
moments
and
charms
,
such
as
when
Jane
Birkin
does
a
cameo
and
sings
one
of
her
own
songs
.

Also
,
the
glossy
amberlike
photography
added
a
very
French
romantic
feeling
to
the
story
,
while
the
mood
of
Paris
as
being
a
place
for
love
to
flourish
above
all
else
,
which
has
always
been
embellished
in
movie
lore
,
comes
through
with
flying
colors
.

It
also
does
a
good
job
of
showing
you
the
way
Paris
is
in
the
1990s
and
in
the
way
ordinary
people
exist
there
.

It
tells
the
romantic
story
of
six
Parisians
who
become
intertwined
with
each
other
in
their
ordinary
lives
as
they
search
for
happiness
.

They
are
the
attractive
sisters
Odile
-LRB-
Sabine
Azéma
-RRB-
and
Camille
-LRB-
Agnes
Jaoui
-RRB-
,
with
the
older
businesswoman
Odile
married
and
decidedly
set
on
a
bourgeois
life
of
material
comforts
.

She
is
married
to
the
glum
and
laconic
Claude
-LRB-
Pierre
Arditi
-RRB-
.

She
once
went
out
with
a
businessman
,
Nicolas
-LRB-
Jean-Pierre
Bacri
-RRB-
,
who
left
her
8-years
ago
and
now
shows
up
in
Paris
and
asks
her
help
to
find
someone
to
rent
a
flat
for
his
family
.

Simon
-LRB-
Andre
Dussolier
-RRB-
works
as
a
real-estate
salesman
and
is
trying
to
find
Nicolas
a
flat
,
in
his
spare
time
he
writes
radio
plays
.

Simon
's
boss
is
the
much
younger
,
unscrupulous
and
arrogant
Marc
Duveyrier
-LRB-
Lambert
Wilson
-RRB-
,
who
inherited
the
firm
from
his
father
and
is
the
real-estate
agent
selling
a
more
luxurious
and
larger
flat
with
a
better
view
to
Odile
,
but
fails
to
tell
her
that
a
building
project
is
going
up
soon
that
will
block
her
view
.

Screenwriters
and
actors
Jean-Pierre
Bacri
and
Agnes
Jaoui
wrote
themselves
the
best
parts
.

Jaoui
's
Camille
is
a
university
scholar
finishing
up
a
Ph.D.
in
history
,
using
for
her
thesis
the
study
of
`
the
yeomen
in
the
year
1000
at
Lake
Paladru
.
'

She
works
as
a
tour
guide
in
the
meantime
and
suffers
from
panic
attacks
,
even
though
she
appears
to
have
outwardly
perfect
self-control
.

On
her
tours
for
the
last
four
years
has
been
the
much
older
Simon
,
pretending
to
be
doing
research
for
his
plays
but
really
attracted
to
her
,
but
not
having
the
nerve
to
tell
her
this
.

To
his
dismay
,
he
finds
out
she
is
dating
his
mean-spirited
but
handsome
boss
,
whom
she
meets
when
looking
at
her
sister
's
new
place
and
seeing
him
crying
but
not
realizing
that
it
was
from
a
cold
,
not
because
he
's
so
sensitive
.

Bacri
as
the
classy
Nicolas
,
turns
out
to
be
now
working
as
a
chauffeur
.

He
is
a
hypochondriac
with
a
history
of
depression
who
visits
many
doctors
,
until
he
finds
one
who
tells
him
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
him
.

Odile
still
pines
for
him
,
but
he
's
married
,
telling
her
he
expects
his
wife
to
arrive
shortly
.

Love
is
`
the
same
old
song
'
that
makes
the
world
go
`
round
,
even
when
all
the
characters
are
liars
and
not
exactly
open
to
what
their
true
motives
are
.

Everything
comes
together
in
a
bourgeois
housewarming
party
for
Odile
's
place
,
as
the
characters
reveal
their
true
feelings
and
all
their
deceptions
and
neurotic
impulses
are
either
uncovered
or
about
to
be
.

There
's
not
a
lot
of
bite
to
this
satirical
musical
,
but
Resnais
has
never
made
a
bad
film
and
is
one
of
the
best
current
French
directors
,
if
not
the
best
.

This
film
is
not
one
his
great
ones
,
but
it
still
has
enough
pep
in
its
light
touches
to
be
interesting
.

It
not
only
has
an
odd
way
for
the
characters
to
break
into
song
but
--
some
males
even
sing
in
a
female
voice
while
some
females
sing
in
a
male
voice
.

It
is
also
interesting
in
the
way
it
examines
its
characters
'
behavior
as
being
similar
in
business
as
in
love
.
