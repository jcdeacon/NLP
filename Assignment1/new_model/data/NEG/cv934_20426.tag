Ex-Universal
Soldier
Luc
has
to
battle
a
group
of
newer-model
engineered
fighters
gone
bad
.

Jean-Claude
Van
Damme
has
a
one-liner
early
on
in
Universal
Soldier
:
The
Return
,
his
latest
attempt
to
remain
relevant
,
that
sums
up
this
entire
movie
;
he
says
``
Been
there
,
done
that
.
''

No
film
critic
could
possibly
sum
up
Van
Damme
's
recent
film
choices
any
better
.

While
other
ageing
action
stars
have
wisely
moved
into
other
film
genres
-LRB-
Schwarzenegger
makes
as
many
family
comedies
as
he
does
action
films
-RRB-
,
Van
Damme
stubbornly
persists
in
sticking
with
what
used
to
work
for
him
:
martial
arts
and
guns
.

This
unwillingness
or
perhaps
inability
to
move
into
new
genres
has
caused
Van
Damme
to
enter
the
straight
to
video
world
,
with
Legionnaire
never
seeing
the
inside
of
a
multiplex
.

He
joins
fellow
martial
artist/action
star
Steven
Seagal
as
they
watch
their
film
careers
rapidly
fizzle
away
.

Universal
Soldier
:
The
Return
is
truly
poor
.

The
plot
is
a
complete
copy
of
several
action
films
from
this
decade
,
specifically
Terminator
2
:
Judgement
Day
and
the
similarly
named
Soldier
.

Soldier
's
Kurt
Russell
was
an
older
model
super-soldier
sent
off
to
retirement
when
circumstances
forced
him
to
battle
his
successors
,
for
the
good
of
a
planet
;
Schwarzenegger
's
Terminator
in
T2
tried
to
save
John
Connor
from
a
newer
model
killing
machine
,
the
T-1000
;
and
Jean-Claude
,
a
former
Universal
Soldier
,
has
to
save
the
planet
from
the
rampage
of
a
group
of
,
you
guessed
it
,
newer
model
Soldiers
.

Considering
the
poor
box
office
performance
of
Soldier
,
it
's
amazing
that
this
project
was
ever
given
the
go-ahead
.

Luc
Devereaux
-LRB-
Van
Damme
-RRB-
was
the
sole
remaining
Universal
Soldier
-LRB-
or
Unisol
for
short
-RRB-
,
until
he
was
returned
to
a
normal
,
if
muscular
,
human
form
.

In
this
sequel
-LRB-
technically
the
fourth
film
in
the
series
,
following
two
straight-to-video
duds
that
were
ignored
here
plot-wise
-RRB-
,
Luc
is
now
a
human
trainer/consultant
of
sorts
for
the
UNISOL
program
.

Working
with
Dylan
Cotner
-LRB-
Xander
Berkeley
,
who
interestingly
also
appeared
in
T2
-RRB-
,
the
UNISOL
program
has
engineered
a
tougher
,
fiercer
fighting
force
with
the
help
of
super-computer
SETH
.

Unfortunately
,
upon
hearing
that
the
program
has
been
axed
by
the
government
,
SETH
takes
control
of
his
soldiers
,
killing
everyone
in
the
building
except
for
Luc
,
his
partner
Maggie
,
his
daughter
Hillary
and
Erin
,
a
reporter
trapped
inside
.

The
rest
of
the
film
involves
Luc
trying
to
keep
them
all
alive
,
while
beating
up
a
group
of
near-indestructible
soldiers
,
most
notably
Romeo
-LRB-
popular
wrestler
Goldberg
-RRB-
.

There
are
lots
of
fights
,
gun
battles
,
lame
plot
developments
and
a
noticeable
lack
of
plausibility
.

There
are
so
many
clichs
in
this
film
that
it
is
almost
painful
to
watch
.

Luc
gets
saddled
with
the
task
of
saving
Erin
the
reporter
early
on
,
and
in
the
course
of
a
single
night
,
they
go
from
bickering
to
falling
for
each
other
,
to
kissing
.

Erin
is
a
pathetically-written
character
;
people
are
getting
brutally
gunned
down
all
around
her
,
and
yet
,
not
only
does
this
not
seem
to
frighten
her
,
but
she
finds
time
to
remind
Luc
that
she
``
is
n't
leaving
without
her
story
''
.

Whatever
.

Other
laughable
moments
include
a
-RRB-
Luc
going
to
a
strip
club
to
get
internet
access
-LRB-
what
?
-RRB-

and
b
-RRB-
a
group
of
Rangers
,
who
after
having
been
given
good
advice
-LRB-
Luc
tells
them
that
their
weapons
are
useless
,
and
shows
them
a
specific
gun
which
should
work
better
-RRB-
,
choose
to
go
into
battle
with
their
useless
weapons
anyway
-LRB-
guess
who
wins
the
battle
?
-RRB-
.

Not
one
single
scene
in
Universal
Soldier
:
The
Return
has
any
originality
to
it
.

When
fuelled
by
Don
Davis
'
loud
,
driving
music
score
,
the
film
's
many
fights
become
almost
passable
,
but
mostly
are
full
of
the
same
ol
'
Jean-Claude
moves
.

Director
Mic
Rodgers
-LRB-
a
former
stunt
co-ordinator
-RRB-
keeps
the
action
coming
at
a
rapid
pace
,
with
only
a
few
token
serious
moments
to
be
found
.

His
past
work
is
evident
in
the
many
moments
when
characters
are
thrown
through
windows
,
tossed
off
of
buildings
or
sent
flying
through
the
air
thanks
to
an
explosion
.

If
only
Jean-Claude
were
n't
getting
so
old
and
slow
compared
to
younger
martial
arts
film
actors
like
Jet
Li
,
Rodgers
could
probably
have
made
a
decent
action
film
.

To
place
the
blame
squarely
at
Van
Damme
's
feet
,
however
,
is
an
injustice
.

I
'm
not
sure
that
anyone
,
not
even
Robert
DeNiro
or
Edward
Norton
,
could
make
writers
William
Malone
and
John
Fasano
's
script
sound
good
.

One
particularly
painful
scene
is
when
Erin
asks
Luc
how
he
is
so
sure
that
the
aforementioned
strip
club
will
have
internet
access
.

He
cringes
,
looks
down
and
mutters
``
uh
...
uhm
...
they
all
do
,
I
saw
it
on
60
Minutes
.

eh
he
he
he
''
The
script
's
and
indeed
the
entire
film
's
only
saving
grace
is
Goldberg
.

He
chews
up
every
scene
he
is
in
,
obviously
enjoying
his
role
immensely
.

He
even
gives
the
film
a
few
laughs
,
as
he
mutters
things
like
``
I
really
do
n't
like
that
guy
''
every
time
he
fails
to
kill
Luc
.

Sadly
,
his
presence
is
not
enough
to
turn
Universal
Soldier
:
The
Return
into
anything
better
than
a
below-average
action
film
that
truly
deserves
to
have
joined
its
fellow
sequels
by
going
straight-to-video
.
