A
black
comedy
set
in
the
near
future
in
a
boarding
house
run
by
a
depraved
butcher
.

The
comedy
is
played
more
in
comic
strip
style
for
entertaining
value
than
for
deeper
satire
,
as
it
features
mostly
zany
sophomoric
sight
gags
and
relies
heavily
on
special
effects
.

The
world
has
fallen
on
hard
times
and
there
are
food
shortages
which
include
no
meat
,
so
the
butcher
serves
up
meat
from
human
flesh
to
customers
who
pay
with
grain
,
almost
as
valued
a
commodity
.

That
's
the
big
joke
in
the
film
and
the
novelty
of
that
cannibalism
idea
wears
thin
mighty
fast
,
as
the
characters
are
too
absurd
and
sketched
too
thinly
for
us
to
care
about
them
.

This
tasteless
postapocalyptic
French
comedy
is
a
first
feature
for
the
co-directors
Marc
Caro/Jean-Pierre
Jeunet
.

It
failed
to
reach
my
funny
bone
and
instead
left
me
mostly
annoyed
at
its
slight
story
and
its
dark
projections
for
the
future
.

An
ex-circus
clown
named
Louison
-LRB-
Dominique
Pinon
-RRB-
,
the
film
's
too-good-to-be-true
hero
,
answers
an
ad
for
work
as
a
handyman
for
Clapet
-LRB-
Jean-Claude
Dreyfus
-RRB-
,
and
the
butcher
and
landlord
,
offers
him
room
and
board
in
his
house
.

The
butcher
's
clumsy
and
near-sighted
daughter
Julie
-LRB-
Marie-Laure
Dougnac
-RRB-
falls
in
love
with
the
skinny
,
weird
looking
clown
,
and
the
two
make
some
music
together
,
with
her
playing
the
cello
and
him
a
saw
.

They
are
the
innocents
,
surrounded
by
a
boarding
house
of
misfits
suffering
from
fear
and
watched
over
by
her
overbearing
father
,
who
has
lured
into
his
tenement
the
clown
,
as
he
has
his
past
innocent
victims
,
so
that
he
can
put
his
cleaver
to
him
and
then
sell
him
as
meat
,
which
he
intends
to
do
as
soon
as
the
clown
fixes
up
the
tenement
.

The
entire
film
takes
place
in
the
shabby
tenement
,
and
the
tenants
are
an
odd
lot
of
bizarre
malcontents
,
who
do
not
trust
each
other
.

There
are
two
youngsters
-LRB-
Boban
Janevski
&
Mikael
Todde
-RRB-
who
do
any
kind
of
mischief
they
can
.

A
frog
man
-LRB-
Howard
Vernon
-RRB-
who
lives
with
water
on
the
floor
so
he
can
raise
his
frogs
and
snails
that
he
eats
.

Two
brothers
-LRB-
Mathou
&
Kube
-RRB-
who
create
little
cow-moo
novelty
toys
.

A
man
-LRB-
Holgado
-RRB-
who
sells
a
bullshit
detector
to
the
butcher
for
his
piece
of
meat
.

A
slutty
woman
-LRB-
Karin
Viard
-RRB-
,
who
lives
with
the
butcher
and
only
wants
his
meat
.

The
aristocratic
woman
-LRB-
Silvie
Laguna
-RRB-
who
tries
numerous
times
to
commit
suicide
but
is
too
inept
to
do
it
right
.

The
tenants
are
too
afraid
to
come
out
at
night
because
they
know
what
the
butcher
is
up
to
,
so
they
are
forced
to
communicate
with
each
other
through
a
pipe
that
runs
through
the
building
-LRB-
in
one
scene
they
are
all
in
musical
harmony
to
the
lovemaking
of
the
butcher
and
his
gal
,
as
their
bedsprings
squeak
-RRB-
.

There
is
also
a
sex-crazed
postman
-LRB-
Chick
Ortega
-RRB-
,
who
lusts
for
the
butcher
's
daughter
and
carries
a
gun
while
delivering
the
mail
.

There
is
also
an
underdeveloped
subplot
about
a
band
of
incompetent
underground
veggie
fanatics
,
called
Trogolodistes
,
who
have
been
summoned
to
rescue
the
clown
and
steal
some
grain
.

The
directors
overloaded
the
film
with
too
many
eccentrics
,
as
the
comedy
seemed
forced
while
the
surreal
look
of
the
film
added
no
dramatic
intensity
.

Delicatessen
could
have
some
appeal
to
the
cult
film
crowd
who
like
their
meat
sliced
thin
,
Monty
Python
fans
,
and
those
who
liked
Terry
Gilliam
's
Brazil
,
a
film
similar
in
spirit
.
