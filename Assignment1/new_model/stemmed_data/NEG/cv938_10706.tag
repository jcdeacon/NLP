comment
:
the
most
notabl
aspect
of
adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
is
that
it
mark
a
strike
career
move
for
natasha
henstridg
.

not
onli
doe
she
manag
to
keep
all
her
cloth
on
-lrb-
her
trademark
in
earlier
film
such
as
speci
and
maximum
risk
wa
to
strip
nake
as
often
as
possibl
-rrb-
,
but
she
actual
put
on
even
more
cloth
as
the
film
progress
.

thi
will
probabl
disappoint
mani
henstridg
fan
,
but
i
welcom
the
chang
becaus
henstridg
is
an
attract
,
capabl
actress
who
deserv
less
exploit
role
-lrb-
though
,
i
admit
,
it
doe
n't
show
in
thi
mess
-rrb-
.

henstridg
,
just
like
everi
other
actor
in
the
film
,
deliv
a
wooden
perform
in
thi
monument
turkei
.

-lrb-
the
cast
also
includ
christoph
lambert
,
who
ha
appear
in
the
highland
and
mortal
kombat
film
.
-rrb-

how
on
earth
thi
movi
got
two
big-name
star
to
appear
in
it
is
beyond
me
.

adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
is
set
in
boston
ten
year
in
the
futur
-lrb-
2007
-rrb-
.

boston
ha
chang
dramat
in
those
ten
year
.

it
is
now
home
to
a
bunch
of
inter
foreign
and
polic
by
cop
who
drive
around
in
small
car
with
``
policia
''
print
on
their
door
.

some
gui
ha
a
realli
bad
viru
,
and
he
's
kill
peopl
becaus
of
it
.

so
,
the
brave
good
gui
-lrb-
lambert
and
henstridg
-rrb-
go
after
him
.

that
's
it
.

76
minut
never
seem
so
long
.

thi
is
a
drawn-out
chase
scene
through
dimli-lit
abandon
build
turn
into
an
entir
movi
.

the
plot
develop
is
nil
;
we
learn
absolut
noth
about
lambert
's
charact
and
veri
littl
about
henstridg
's
charact
.

the
dialogu
is
litter
with
unnecessari
obscen
and
concern
mindnumbingli
idiot
argument
over
who
will
go
down
the
next
dark
corridor/tunnel/airduct
next
and
who
will
carri
the
flashlight
.

a
subplot
doe
exist
involv
henstridg
's
charact
's
illeg
attempt
to
get
her
son
out
of
boston
.

in
her
open
monologu
,
a
monologu
which
sound
as
though
henstridg
wa
read
from
cue
card
,
we
learn
that
she
ha
gone
to
great
length
to
secur
a
fake
passport
for
her
son
.

twenti
minut
into
the
film
,
i
wonder
if
the
movi
would
have
been
better
if
it
focus
on
thi
plot
.

in
a
defin
scene
of
the
movi
,
howev
,
i
chang
my
mind
.

thi
fake
passport
drop
to
the
ground
.

lambert
's
cop
immedi
recogn
it
as
a
fraud
from
six
feet
awai
.

must
not
have
been
a
good
fake
.

thi
emphas
anoth
fault
with
the
film
.

thing
just
defi
common
sens
.

lambert
's
cop
,
for
instanc
,
is
shot
seven
time
,
yet
he
is
still
abl
to
talk
and
slide
about
.

adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
end
in
a
trite
manner
that
doe
n't
seem
to
even
fit
the
mood
that
the
filmmak
were
try
for
.

i
found
myself
rather
bore
with
thi
film
,
which
will
disappoint
both
sci-fi/horror
fan
and
fan
of
henstridg
and
lambert
.

do
n't
fear
the
rush
.

fear
the
movi
.

watch
someth
els
.
