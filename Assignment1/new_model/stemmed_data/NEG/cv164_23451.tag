a
veri
young
child
try
and
tell
a
joke
that
is
beyond
hi

or
her
,
sophist
?

it
's
full
of
stop
and
start
and
usual
,
the
punch
line
is
ruin
.

i
felt
the
same
wai
watch
drown
mona
.

skip
a
stone
across
water
and
you
approxim
the
depth
of
thi
attempt
at
an
ensembl
comedi
.

there
ar
some
slightli
success
attempt
at
humor
,
but
thei
onli
serv
as
window
dress
.

there
is
a
run
gag
about
the
town
,
verplanck
,
n.y.
,
be
a
test
town
for
the
then
new
yugo
.

everyon

a
yugo
,
differenti
their
car
with
person
licens
plate
.

even
the
polic
chief
drive
on
.

there
is
a
certain
sublim
to
the
imag
of
a
light
and
siren
deck
out
yugo
skitter
it
wai
through
the
town
street
.

there
also
is
a
run
gag
about

hand
and
how
it
occur
.

it
poke
gentl
fun
at
the
notion
of
urban
legend
.

it
turn
out
the
truth
is
more
horrifi
than
ani
legend
.

there
ar
some
sight
gag
that
pop
up
as
well
,
such
as
mona
's
tombston
,
which
read
``
demot
''
,
instead
of
devot
.

still
,
the
core
of
the
stori
maintain
the
flat
of
a
still
pond
.

the
lynchpin
of
the
film
fall
on
the
redund
and
sporad
scene
involv
mona

.

each
scene
with
her
is
the
same
:
scream
at

hit
someon
,
then
scream
some
more
.

there
's
no
uniqu
or
modul
to
her
or
explan
for
her
mean
.

anyon
off
the
street
could
have
plai
the
role
,
such
as
it
is
.

the
other
charact
ar
walk
cardboard
cutout
.

each
on
is
defin
by
on
trait
and
no
further
attempt
is
made
at
deeper
character
.

there
is
a
burli
,
femal
car
mechan
,
so
of
cours
,
there
is
a
forc
lesbian
gag
.

mona

there
's
noth

ell
,
the
chief
's
daughter
-lrb-
campbel
-rrb-
,
is
bland
personifi
,
a
duti
girl
with
no
higher
aspir
than
to
have
a
child
and
be
marri
.

obviou
dullard
.

there
is
no
contrast
to
ani
of
the
charact
.

by
have
at
least
on
charact
with
some
wit
,
or
wit
,
to
serv
as
counterpoint
to
the
other
,
perhap
steinfeld
's
attempt
at
satir
a
small
town
infest
with
ambitionless
peopl
might
have
come
off
better
.

ostens

,
drown
mona
give
you
almost
all
the
clue

,
then
let
you
sit
back
and
feel
superior
as
you
watch
the
cast
of
paper
peopl
fumbl
their
wai
to
find
the
killer
,
who
could
be
anyon
due
to
mona

love
manner
with
everyon
on

even
that
aspect
of
the

throw
in
a
conveni

ridicul
and
unsatisfi

it
's
been
a

sinc
i
walk
awai
from
