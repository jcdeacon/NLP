to

's
film
the

as

would

it

it
would

rare

attempt
to
be

utilis
a

of

but
appear
to
overlook
the
fact
that
nobodi
in
the
film
is
remot
interest
and
that
all
of
the
charact
ar
essenti
preposter

the
film
is
set
in

and
the

it

not

much
to

is
essenti
that
allud
to
at

it
could
be
madden
to
endur
a
film
whose
central
protagonist
is
so
oblivi
of
the
ongo
blatant
manipul
,
but
fortun
thi
is
not
the
case
in

,
if
onli
becaus
our

such
a

;
not
even
remot
sympathet

compel
,
it
becom
imposs
to
root
for
philip
or
even
care
about

,
and
the
would-be
swindler
of

ar
all
drawn
out
as
such
ludicr
,
transpar
buffoon
with
entir
unimagin
and
uninterest
scheme
that
on
watch
the
winner
with
a
complet
sens
of
disinterest
.

it
is
a
shame
,
as
the
winner
featur
a
talent
cast-mr
.

d'onofrio
is
an
underr
and
gift
actor
with
a
huge
rang
;
mr.
lindo
ha
a
remark
screen
presenc
which
infiltr
everi
film
in
which
he
appear
;
mr.
madsen
,
ms.
demornai
,
and
mr.
whalei
have
all
done
good
work
in
the
past
.

none
of
the
actor
in
the
winner
ar
in
top
form
here
,
and
thi
film
wo
n't
like
be
a
prize
addit
to
their
respect
resum
.

director
alex
cox
doe
what
he
can
with
wendi
riss
'
screenplai
,
and
it
is
to
hi
credit
that
thi
film
at
no
point
feel
like
an
adapt
of
a
stage
plai
;
i
wa
startl
to
learn
that
the
winner
wa
in
fact
base
upon
on
.

while
tediou
,
the
film
is
well-pace
and
doe
not
meander
,
but
it
would
be
near-imposs
task
for
mr.
cox
-lrb-
or
,
for
that
matter
,
virtual
ani
other
director
that
come
to
mind
-rrb-
to
overcom
the
film
's
widespread
shortcom
in
plot
and
character
.

to
hi
credit
,
my
understand
is
that
he
ha
chosen
to
distanc
himself
from
the
project
in
acknowledg
of
it
defici
.

i
caught
the
winner
at
it
world
premier
at
the
toronto
intern
film
festiv
in
septemb
1996
,
and
in
fair
it
is
entir
possibl
that
the
film
ha
been
extens
revamp
sinc
then
due
to
the
lacklustr
audienc
reaction
gener-there
were
more
walkout
on
thi
film
than
ani
of
the
other
i
screen
.

to
be
honest
,
though
,
i
could
n't
begin
to
isol
what
could
be
done
to
thi
film
to
improv
it-i
assum
that
throw
the
whole
thing
out
and
start
over
is
out
of
the
question
.

the
winner
ha
appar
plai
on
cabl
televis
in
the
unit
state
and
is
begin
a
limit
theatric
releas
at
the
time
of
thi
write
.

the
film
ha
a
nice
upbeat
score
by
prai
for
rain
,
but
i
am
honestli
not
be
faceti
when
i
state
that
the
thing
i
treasur
most
about
my
screen
of
the
winner
wa
the
bag
of
popcorn
upon
which
i
wa
munch
.
