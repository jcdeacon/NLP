``

not

from

it
's
easi
to
see
why
some
of
the
larger
,
more
reput
chain
ar
n't
carri
it
:
the
film
look
like
a
straight-to-video

that

becaus
sarah

-lrb-
you
wo

wherea

her

on
the

,
dobi

is

in
a
scene
in
which
he
thumb
through
an

the

could
have
been
just
as
easili
condens
.

``

``

.

late
in

,
their

final

with
mind-numb
result
.

nobodi
els
in
the

appear
to
mind
all
the
racket
,
but
on
old
dear
doe
go
ballist
when
sarah

bathtub
overflow
.

no
,
we
do
n't
see
wright
in
the
tub
-lrb-
or
fahei
for
that
matter
-rrb-
,
and
the
gore
quotient
is
virtual
nil
,
so
for
a
horror
film
``
the
sculptress
''
is
surprisingli
lack
.

the
onli
thing
worth
look
at
is
san
francisco
,
and
writer/director
ian
merrick
manag
to
make
even
it
look
dreari
,
windswept
,
and
desert
.

``
the
sculptress
''
is
n't
even
bad
enough
to
be
fun
.

luckili
,
a
limit
releas
ha
made
it
easi
to
avoid
.
