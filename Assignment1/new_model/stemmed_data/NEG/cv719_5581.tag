it
's
around
thi
time
that
peopl
in
the
theatr
with
me
start
hum
the
mission
:
imposs
theme
,
becaus
arni
's
mission
includ
break
into
a
high-secur
build
to
run
a
disk
.

i
guess
i
should
tell
you
more
about
the
particular
gun
everyon
in
thi
movi
is
so
antsi
about
.

it
's
an
electro-magnet
puls
gun
thing
which
fire
aluminium
missil
,
and
which
can
see
through
wall
.

it
ha
some
sort
of
x-rai
vision
,
so
it
user
can
target
the
victim
's
heart
even
from
great
distanc
.

despit
thi
,
which
i
figur
is
a
pretti
cool
featur
in
a
gun
-lrb-
though
i
'm
certainli
no
expert
-rrb-
,
howev
,
arnold
,
whose
own
heart
is
target
a
number
of
time
,
never
goe
flyingfeet
backward
with
a
two-foot
missil
through
hi
chest
like
all
the
other
who
get
shot
by
thi
gun
.

instead
he
outrun
and
outsmart
hi
tracker
each
time
,
give
eeri
and
iron
reson
to
that
termin
line
that
practic
made
him
famou
:
``
i
'll
be
back
.
''

like
everyon
els
in
the
theater
,
i
left
the
movi
feel
that
the
trailer
had
dupe
me
,
becaus
thei
made
me
want
to
watch
thi
movi
voluntarili
.

although
there
is
a
lot
of
violenc
in
thi
movi
,
not
to
mention
mutil
and
some
bloodi
tussl
with
allig
,
i
recommend
thi
movi
to
most
over-18s
who
need
some
therapeut
mindless
action
to
get
over
the
weird
of
fargo
or
the
hangov
effect
of
leav
la
vega
.
