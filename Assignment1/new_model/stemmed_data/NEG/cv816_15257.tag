try
reprogram

so
that

now
contain
the
lyric
``
i
still

''
-rrb-

all
is
not
lost-rai
is
on
hi
wai
to
save
the
dai
,
and
a
help
witch
doctor
is
sai
littl
prayer
for
juli
and
co.
.

thi
pictur
is
realli
about
breast
:
two
of
them
.

juli
,
like
a
good
horror
heroin
,
never
doe
up
her
shirt
to
the
collar
,
alwai
wear
white
in
the
rain
,
and
keep
sexi
underwear
on
in
case
of
a
sudden
desir
to
tan
.

base
on
the
hormon
charg
i
got
out
of
the
movi
,
i
ca
n't
imagin
what
it
wa
do
to
the
ten
year
old
boi
who
sat
next
to
me-he
get
jennif
love-hewitt
,
and
my

lucki
bastard
.

i
did
n't
like
i
know
what
you
did
last
summer
and
i
ca
n't
sai
i
like
thi
continu
ani
more
or
less
.

the
pace
in
both
film
is
languid-how
is
it
that
so
much
time
pass
with
neither
murder
nor
charact
develop
?

i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
ha
a
better
sens
of
humour
than
the
first
on
,
though
,
and
at
least
it
explain
awai
willi
's
random
select
of
victim
.

-lrb-
i
do
n't
think
the
hotel
maid
or
the
stoner
dude
had
the
slightest
idea
what
juli
did
last
summer
.

try
to
keep

number
of

to
a
minimum
