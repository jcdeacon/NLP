it
's
probabl
inevit
that
the
popular
virtual
realiti
genr
-lrb-
``
the
matrix
,
''
``
existenz
''
-rrb-
would
collid
with
the
even
more
popular
serial-killer
genr
-lrb-
``
kiss
the
girl
,
''
``
se7en
''
-rrb-
.

the
result
should
have
been
more
interest
than
``
the
cell
.
''

as
the
movi
open
,
therapist
catharin
dean
-lrb-
jennif
lopez
-rrb-
treat
a
cataton
boi
-lrb-
colton
jame
-rrb-
by
enter
hi
mind
through
some
sort
of
virtual
realiti
techniqu
that
's
never
fulli
explain
.

after
month
of
therapi
session
in
a
surreal
desert
,
catharin
ha
no
success
to
report
.

meanwhil
,
killer
carl
stargher
-lrb-
vincent
d'onofrio
-rrb-
ha
claim
anoth
victim
.

hi
particular
hobbi
is
to
kidnap
young
women
,
keep
them
in
a
glass
cell
overnight
,
and
drown
them
.

he
take
the
corps
and
soak
it
in
bleach
,
then
suspend
himself
over
the
bodi
and
jerk
off
while
watch
a
video
tape
of
the
drown
.

although
carl
's
been
do
thi
for
awhil
,
he
's
recent
becom
sloppi
,
and
fbi
agent
peter
novak
-lrb-
vinc
vaughn
-rrb-
is
close
in
fast
.

not
fast
enough
,
though
,
to
keep
carl
from
stick
anoth
woman
-lrb-
tara
subkoff
-rrb-
in
the
cell
or
to
catch
him
befor
he
suffer
a
schizophren
attack
that
leav
him
in
a
coma
.

from
the
video
in
carl
's
hous
,
peter
can
see
that
the
drown
cell
is
autom
and
will
fill
with
water
forti
hour
after
the
abduct
.

to
save
the
kidnap
girl
,
peter
ha
to
find
the
cell
befor
the
end
of
the
dai
,
and
comatos
carl
's
not
talk
.

so
off
thei
go
to
catharin
in
the
hope
that
she
can
go
insid
carl
's
mind
and
find
out
where
the
cell
is
in
time
.

the
focu
of
``
the
cell
''
in
on
the
ornat
interior
of
carl
's
mind
,
but
the
univers
director
tarsem
singh
creat
seem
more
an
exercis
in
comput-gener
spectacl
than
an
explor
of
the
psychot
person
.

for
the
most
part
,
it
's
style
without
substanc
.

in
hi
own
mind
,
carl
is
a
decad
emperor
in
flow
robe
,
ming
the
merciless
,
as
well
as
a
frighten
boi
-lrb-
jake
thoma
-rrb-
abus
by
hi
father
.

all
in
all
,
the
mind
of
a
psycho
killer
turn
out
to
be
a
strang
dull
place
,
and
i
kept
wish
i
could
fast-forward
to
the
next
develop
.

singh
is
best
known
for
direct
music
video
,
particularli
rem
's
``
lose
my
religion
,
''
and
``
the
cell
''
seem
veri
much
like
a
realli
long
,
realli
slow
mtv
video
with
the
sound
delet
.

singer
lopez
seem
to
think
she
's
in
a
video
as
well
;
she
devot
more
time
to
pose
in
elabor
costum
than
she
doe
to
act
.

the
premis
had
great
promis
.

the
comput-gener
world
within
carl
's
mind
could
have
been
a
bizarr
,
surreal
univers
govern
by
insan
and
symbol
rather
than
logic
.

the
first
room
catharin
enter
in
carl
's
head
show
thi
promis
.

she
find
a
hors
stand
in
center
of
the
room
;
suddenli
,
sheet
of
sharp-edg
glass
fall
into
the
hors
,
divid
it
into
segment
.

the
pane
of
glass
separ
,
pull
apart
the
piec
of
the
still-live
hors
.

thi
scene
is
twist
,
disturb
,
and
thought-provok
,
becaus
the
psycholog
import
of
the
hors
and
it
fate
is
left
to
the
viewer
to
ponder
.

anoth
element
that
should
have
been
develop
is
the
effect
on
catharin
of
merg
with
the
mind
of
a
psychopath
.

their
mind
begin
to
bleed
togeth
at
on
point
in
the
movi
,
and
thi
should
have
provid
an
opportun
to
discov
the
dark
corner
of
catharin
's
own
psych
.

like
sidnei
lumet
's
``
the
offenc
''
or
michael
mann
's
``
manhunt
,
''
``
the
cell
''
could
have
explor
how
the
mad
of
the
killer
bring
out
a
repress
dark
in
the
investig
.

howev
,
catharin
's
charact
is
hardli
develop
at
all
,
and
lopez
ha
no
depth
to
offer
the
role
.
