imag
,
henc
sam

thing
start
to
fall
apart
for
kate
,
as
it
becom
appar
that
nick
realli
like
her
,
and
doe
not
wish
to
break
up
with
her
.

after
some
provok
nick
doe
oblig
,
but
problem
continu
for
kate
.

it
appear
sam

no
longer
interest
now
that
she
is
avail
.

or
mayb
kate
doe
like
nick
,
but
``
reconcili
''
will
forc
her
to
admit
her
li
to
her
employ
.

ad
to
her
mess
is
the
constant
pry
of
her
mother
-lrb-
olympia
dukaki
-rrb-
,
who
want
her
to
get
marri
and
settl
down
.

there
is
a
scene
in
thi
movi
where
jennif
aniston
is
-lrb-
from
the
waist
up
-rrb-
onli
wear
a
bra
.

it
made
me
chuckl
becaus
it
is
the
onli
time
in
the
movi
when
she
actual
wear
on
.

there
is
enough
cleavag
in
thi
movi
to
satisfi
russ
meyer
.

it
's
like
the
director
said
`
well
,
we
know
the
stori
is
formula
and
the
perform
ar
n't
that
great
so
,
what
the
heck
,
let
's
show
jennif
's
asset
as
often
and
as
uncov
as
humanli
possibl
to
keep
the
pg
rate
.
''
''

quit
frankli
it
's
insult
.

i
do
n't
think
aniston
is
a
compet
enough
actress
to
carri
a
movi
.

she
did
a
decent
enough
job
in
ed
burn
'
``
she
's
the
on
''
becaus
it
wa
a
smaller
and
support
role
,
and
she
just
doe
n't
deliv
the
good
effect
in
thi
movi
.

her
perform
wa
not
convinc
.

unfortun
,
as
far
as
romant
comedi
go
,
thi
movi
add
noth
new
to
the
standard
formula
for
these
type
of
movi
.

the
film
is
similar
to
``
my
best
friend
wed
''
in
a
sens
that
the
lead
femal
charact
is
actual
quit
vindict
and
due
her
action
,
get
no
sympathi
from
me
when
thing
go
awri
.

i
did
n't
care
for
how
quickli
kate
put
down
nick
's
profess
by
explain
that
videotap
wed
wa
n't
glamor
enough
for
her
co-worker
.

at
least
``
my
best
friend
wed
''
chang
the
formula
a
bit
and
had
a
somewhat
surpris
end
.

no
such
luck
with
``
pictur
perfect
''
.

everi
plot
occurr
can
be
spot
a
mile
awai
,
includ
a
coupl
that
realli
made
no
sens
.

after
everyth
kate
had
done
to
prove
her
loyalti
to
her
compani
,
why
would
she
blindli
throw
it
all
awai
when
she
should
have
made
sure
that
nick
would
even
talk
to
her
first
,
let
alon
consid
a
relationship
?

wa
quit
her
job
a
prerequisit
to
make
amend
with
nick
?

throw
in
the
fact
that
i
do
n't
think
nick
and
kate
spent
enough
time
togeth
to
even
warrant
that
rash
of
a
decis
.

i
believ
that
kate
like
him
,
but
like
him
so
intens
that
she
wa
will
to
throw
her
career
awai
?

i
doubt
it
.

and
what
of
the
end
scene
at
a
wed
where
the
entir
congreg
feel
it
necessari
to
stop
everyth
and
stare
at
the
coupl
?

ar
mass
group
of
peopl
simultan
that
interest
in
total
stranger
?

well
,
i
guess
of
the
congreg
consist
of
movi
extra
and
the
stranger
ar
the
movi
two
lead
star
,
then
that
would
make
sens
.
