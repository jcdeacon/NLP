,
and
frequent
view
of

howev
,
it
wa
definit
not
a
movi
that
cri
out
for
a
sequel
.

and
,
consid
the
qualiti
of
speci
2
,
it
's
obviou
that
mgm
should
have
stop
while
thei
were
ahead
.

the
onli
thing
that
distinguish
speci
2
is
how
aw
it
is
.

if
you
throw
awai
the
plot
,
which
is
character
by
a
blatant
disregard
for
intellig
,
logic
,
coher
,
and
consist
,
speci
2
actual
ha
a
few
thing
to
recommend
it
to
a
select
audienc
.

of
cours
,
that
audienc
is
primarili
compris
of
teenag
boi
-lrb-
who
,
at

in

should
n't
be
abl

rate
film
-rrb-
and
connoisseur
of
bad
movi
.

there
's
enough
blood
,
gore
,
simul
sex
,
and
bare
flesh
in
speci
2
to
prevent
it
from
ever
becom
bore
.

thi
is
a
grade
z
exploit
flick
that
's
ripe
for
the
mysteri
scienc
theater
3000
treatment
.

somewher

hear
speci

describ

i
would
love
to
know
who

that
adject
for
thi
movi
,
becaus
he
-lrb-
or
she
-rrb-
ha
a
peculiar
notion
of
erotic
.

sure
,
there
's
a
lot
of
sex
and
nuditi
,
but
it
's
almost
alwai
accompani
by
the
rip
open
of
a
woman
's
abdomen
as
an

i

the

do
i
recommend
the

?

absolut
not

i
will
admit
that
speci

is
dopei
enough
that
it
