he
brought
to
``

''
``
tomb
raider
''
is
an
empti-head
,
big
budget
bore
.

the
stori
borrow
unintellig
from
that
mother
of
all
turkei
``
hudson
hawk
''
-lrb-
the
same
hokum
about
planetari
align
and
sacr

that
,
when
brought

...
who
the
heck

and
it
make

-lrb-
bob

ill-advis
career
move
-rrb-
look
like
``
rocco
and
hi
brother
''
-lrb-
that
classic
of
italian
neo-realism
-rrb-
.

i
'll
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
sai
i
suspect
there
's
actual
more
charact
develop
in
the
video
game
than
the
movi
proper
.

thi
is
where
the
joli
defend/video
game
nut
jump
in
and
sai
thi
movi
is
n't
about
charact
develop
it
's
about
kick
seriou
butt
-lrb-
or
bum
,
sinc
ms.
croft
hail
from
england
's
green
and
pleasant
-rrb-
.

with
lip
,
breast
,
and
bicep
all
inflat
to
the
max
,
lara
croft
is
all
about
postur
,
and
joli
ha
a
hard
time
simpli
stand
still
without
try
to
look
tough
.

ok
,
let
's
forget
challeng
.

should
n't
``
tomb
raider
''
be
,
at
the
veri
least
,
fun
and
excit
?

should
n't
our
butt-kick
heroin
also
encompass
the
sophist
of
,
sai
,
jame
bond
with
the
wit
of
indiana
jone
?

there
's
no
humor
to
be
found
anywher
in
``
tomb
raider
,
''
even
though
it
tri
hard
from
time
to
time
.

even
``
the
mummi
return
''
did
n't
take
itself
too
serious
.

the
villain
here
is
notic
lack
,
the
special
effect
ar
ridicul
overblown
and
unnecessarili
complic
,
and
the
script
is
non-exist
.

to
liven
thing
up
-lrb-
perhap
-rrb-
,
joli
's
live
father
jon
voight
put
in
a
few
minut
as
lara
's
dead
father
lord
croft
;
talk
about
a
stretch
.

on
thing
i
had
n't
expect
from
the
film
is
that
joli
affect
a
slightli
better
english
accent
than
her
pa
-lrb-
although
i
suspect
that
thin-look
moustach
he
's
forc
to
wear
get
in
the
wai
some
