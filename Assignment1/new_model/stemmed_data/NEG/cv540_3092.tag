whether
or
not
i
would
be
consid
a
trekker
probabl
depend
on
whom
you
would
ask
.

i
have
been
a
fan
of
both
the
origin
seri
and
it
recent
retir
follow-up
,
as
well
as
the
even-number
entri
in
the
film
seri
.

howev
,
i
have
never
been
on
of
those
folk
who
store
awai
trek
minutia
and
get
into
debat
over
the
rel
merit
of
spock
vs.
data
.

somewher
along
the
line
,
the
``
star
trek
''
film
seri
began
to
seem
more
and
more
direct
at
those
in
the
latter
categori
,
and
star
trek
:
gener
mai
be
the
natur
conclus
of
thi
direct
.

it
product
valu
mai
be
high
,
but
the
write
is
frequent
appal
,
and
instead
of
a
script
ha
a
collect
of
refer
,
in-joke
and
ill-defin
charact
.

gener
open
in
the
late
23rd
centuri
,
where
member
of
the
origin
enterpris
crew
,
includ
captain
jame
t.
kirk
-lrb-
william
shatner
-rrb-
,
ar
present
for
the
christen
of
the
latest
ship
to
bear
that
name
.

no
sooner
is
it
out
on
it
maiden
voyag
than
a
distress
signal
bring
them
to
the
nexu
,
a
mysteri
ribbon
of
energi
.

among
those
rescu
from
the
nexu
is
long-live
alien
dr.
soran
-lrb-
malcolm
mcdowel
-rrb-
,
but
he
is
none-too-pleas
at
be
back
in
the
real
world
.

seventi-eight
year
later
,
soran
is
still
try
to
get
back
to
the
nexu
,
and
again
encount
an
enterpris
,
thi
on
led
by
captain
jean-luc
picard
-lrb-
patrick
stewart
-rrb-
.

soran
's
plan
involv
destroi
a
star
with
an
inhabit
planet
,
and
the
onli
hope
for
save
230
million
peopl
is
the
histor
meet
of
two
enterpris
captain
.

i
do
n't
think
it
is
an
insult
to
fan
of
``
star
trek
''
to
suggest
that
to
a
certain
extent
,
the
particular
of
a
plot
ar
not
realli
the
most
import
element
in
a
``
trek
''
film
.

it
's
about
a
chanc
to
visit
with
old
friend
,
and
if
thei
ar
involv
in
a
truli
interest
stori
it
can
be
consid
gravi
.

but
even
that
interpret
assum
that
character
ha
to
be
consist
,
and
in
gener
that
just
doe
n't
happen
.

data
-lrb-
brent
spiner
-rrb-
is
particularli
victim
by
thi
sloppi
write
.

in
the
film
's
major
sub-plot
,
data
decid
to
us
a
chip
which
will
give
him
human
emot
,
a
chip
he
ha
had
in
hi
possess
for
over
a
year
.

what
is
hi
motiv
for
take
thi
drastic
and
perhap
danger
step
?

he
doe
n't
get
a
joke
.

onc
the
chip
is
in
place
,
spiner
get
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
data
's
new
emot
,
but
the
point
is
that
he
's
no
longer
the
data
we
know
.

if
the
rest
of
the
``
next
gener
''
cast
fare
ani
better
,
it
's
onli
becaus
thei
're
on
the
screen
so
littl
that
thei
're
simpli
window
dress
.

but
then
again
,
thi
stori
is
n't
realli
about
the
new
crew
.

it
's
about
kirk
and
picard
,
the
cowboi
and
the
politician
,
share
the
screen
.

the
huge
surpris
is
that
william
shatner
blow
patrick
stewart
awai
.

perhap
becaus
he
know
thi
is
hi
last
go-round
in
the
part
that
made
him
a
legend
,
shatner
look
like
he
's
have
the
time
of
hi
life
;
stewart
,
on
the
other
hand
,
border
on
the
deferrenti
,
and
is
saddl
with
the
same
lacklust
motiv
as
everyon
els
in
the
cast
.

stewart
's
edgi
is
indic
of
what
mai
be
a
veri
bad
sign
for
paramount
's
hope
to
turn
the
new
cast
into
the
same
kind
of
franchis
the
origin
cast
wa
:
these
ar
clearli
the
not
readi
for
big
screen
player
.

by
contrast
,
the
prologu
which
featur
scotti
-lrb-
jame
doohan
-rrb-
and
chekhov
-lrb-
walter
koenig
-rrb-
is
the
highlight
of
the
film
.

these
charact
have
becom
part
of
the
popular
mytholog
,
and
when
thei
take
over
the
enterpris
in
a
moment
of
distress
,
it
's
a
moment
of
high
energi
.

onli
thirti
year
of
histori
can
creat
a
moment
like
that
,
and
that
's
time
thi
new
crew
doe
n't
have
.

it
certainli
doe
n't
help
that
the
plot
thei
ar
stuck
in
is
so
convolut
and
badli
construct
that
you
need
to
leav
a
trail
of
bread
crumb
to
find
your
wai
out
again
.

it
's
also
load
with
littl
gag
all
aim
at
those
who
ar
familiar
enough
with
the
seri
to
turn
to
all
their
friend
in
a
share
nudg
of
recognit
.

i
wonder
whether
anyon
who
is
come
in
cold
to
the
``
trek
''
univers
at
thi
point
would
be
anyth
but
baffl
and
bore
by
what
is
go
on
.

and
what
a
wast
of
malcolm
mcdowel
,
who
could
have
been
a
great
monoman
villain
but
should
have
been
given
a
much
more
compel
reason
for
hi
obsess
.

there
ar
plenti
of
detail
both
scientif
and
of
continu
to
pick
at
,
but
to
do
so
would
be
to
ignor
gener
'
major
flaw
.

howev
,
i
would
like
to
make
on
recommend
:
seatbelt
.

not
just
for
the
enterpris
crew
,
although
you
'd
think
by
the
24th
centuri
space
travel
would
n't
involv
roll
around
on
the
floor
dure
a
battl
.

no
,
i
think
the
audienc
might
need
them
more
.

thi
journei
is
on
bumpi
ride
.
