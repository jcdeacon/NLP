is
hollywood
famili
fare
at
it
deadli
worst
.

mous
hunt
take
the
bare
thread
of
a
plot
and
tri
to
prop
it
up
with
overact
and
flat-out
stupid
slapstick
that
make
comedi
like
jingl
all
the
wai
look
decent
by

learn
that
it
's

and
increasingli
uninspir
slapstick
that
becom
all
sound
and
furi

the
script
becom
so
unspeak
bad
that
the
best
line
poor
lee
even
can
utter
after
anoth
run
in
with
the
rodent
is
:
``
i
hate

.

oh
cring
!

thi
is
home
alon
all
over
again
,
and
ten

hi
makeshift
abod
somewher
in

he
jump
into
a

,
pull
up
a
makeshift
sheet
and
snuggl
up
to
sleep
,
seemingli
happi
and
just
want
to
be
left
alon
.

it
's
a
magic
littl
moment
in
an
otherwis
soulless
film
.

a
messag
to
speilberg
:
if
you
want
dreamwork
to
be
associ
with
some
kind
of
artist
credibl
,
then
either
give
all
concern
in
mous
hunt
a
swift
kick
up
the
ars
or
hire
yourself
some
decent
writer
and
director
.

thi
kind
of
rubbish
will
just
not
do
at
all
.
