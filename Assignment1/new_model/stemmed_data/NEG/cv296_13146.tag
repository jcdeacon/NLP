everyon

that
old
rule
,
'
never
work
with
children
and
anim
.
'

in
thi
latest
horror
flick
mimic
case
,
it
's
'
never
work
with
children
and
genet
enhanc
killer
anim
'
instead
,
as
mimic
featur
both
of
these
and
succe
in
do
noth
except
mildli
engag
the
audienc
.

the
film
begin
in
new
york
,
where
we
see
children
dy
from
a
mysteri
diseas
,
which
is
be
carri
by
cockroach
.

dr.
susan
tyler
-lrb-
sorvino
-rrb-
creat
a
genet
enhanc
bug
-lrb-
the
'
juda
'
breed
-rrb-
,
howev
,
which
is
design
to
kill
all
cockroach
.

the
bug
doe
it
's
job
,
the
cockroach
all
die
,
and
the
terror
is
gone
.
'

three
year
later
'
appear
on
the
screen
,
and
we
discov
that
the
juda
breed
is
back
,
bigger
than
ever
,
and
readi
to
kill
.

the
spin
on
thi
bug
,
howev
,
is
that
it
can
mimic
it
's
predat
,
and
in
thi
case
...
.

it
's
human
.

that
should
teach
us
for
squish
all
those
bug
.

what
should
be
a
roller
coaster
ride
with
bug
everywher
,
ton
of
gori
death
and
some
massiv
set
piec
instead
turn
out
to
be
a
rather
subdu
,
almost
bore
movi
which
plod
along
at
a
veri
slow
pace
.

perhap
the
movi
wa
try
to
be
thought
provok
,
and
try
to
avoid
the
'
predat
'
type
movi
it
could
easili
have
becom
.

if
it
is
,
then
the
director
and
writer
have
made
the
wrong
move
,
becaus
thi
is
perfectli
suit
to
be
an
all
out
action
fest
.

the
director
,
who
bought
us
crono
,
a
far
superior
film
,
direct
the
film
in
a
calm
,
and
frankli
dull
movi
.

there
ar
few
excit
sequenc
,
instead
just
a
lot
of
peopl
talk
.

if
the
dialogu
wa
intellig
,
then
it
would
be
all
right
,
but
it
's
sadli
babbl
nonsens
.

in
fact
,
the
script
is
embarrsingli
weak
,
and
the
character
not
much
better.sorvino
and
compani
ar
as
2d
as
charact
come
,
with
the
script
not
bother
to
develop
them
.

there
is
some
action
in
thi
film
,
but
it
's
direct
in
such
an
annoi
wai
,
it
's
just
infuri
to
watch
.

the
camera
cut
all
over
the
place
,
disoreit
the
audienc
,
and
instead
of
involv
the
audienc
in
the
action
,
it
mere
alien
them
.

the
peform
ar
o.k
,
if
slightli
below
averag
.

sorvino
is
o.k
,
although
she
's
not
veri
good
at
convei
terror
,
or
anyth
emot
realli
.

the
support
cast
ar
all
sterotyp
,
with
charact
such
as
a
big
black
secur
guard
with
a
foul
mouth
,
a
geeki
scientist
with
spectacl
,
and
what
could
be
the
most
stereotyp
mexican
'
old
timer
'
ever
.

their
reason
good
fun
,
howev
.

mimic
,
then
,
mai
fail
with
it
's
stori
,
pace
and
charact
,
but
the
film
doe
look
good
.

like
dark
citi
,
mimic
is
a
definit
case
of
style
of
content
.

it
mai
be
a
bit
too
gloomi
for
it
's
own
good
,
but
the
set
look
nice
,
and
part
of
the
film
ar
direct
well
.

but
look
ar
n't
good
enough
to
save
mimic
from
the
depth
of
mediocr
,
somewher
where
it
should
n't
realli
belong
.

a
good
opportun
,
then
,
wast
.

a
shame
.
