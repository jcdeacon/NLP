place
,
but
the
stori
,
by

when

think
about
it
,
thi
is
a
real
mishmash
of
contriv
and
coincid
that
is
held
togeth
sole
by
the
comed
effort
of
steve

the
pair
is
abl
to
elicit
the
film

onli
laugh
with
their
goofi
antic
and
child-like
behavior
.

thei
ar
releg
to
provid
slapstick
gui
humor
and
the
two
ar
more
than

the
neat
