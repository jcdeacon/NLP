n't
get
me
wrong

i
tend
to
appreci
besson
's
naiv
,
unashamedli
romant
worldview
,
an
artsi
european
sensibl
gone
thoroughli
hollywood
.

hi
1994
leon
is
excit
and
absurdli
move
,
thank
mainli
to
the
interplai
between
jean
reno
and
a
young
natali
portman
,
and
1997
's
the
fifth
element
is
a
goofi
paean
to
love
,
l-u-v
,
that
's
even
more
of
a
hoot
on
repeat
view
.

but
hi
joan
of
arc
is
a
mess
,
despit
some
stir
battl
scene
and
the
mostli
knockout
presenc
of
a
close-crop
milla
jovovich
as
the
maiden
herself
.

jovovich
,
besson
's
own
person
muse
through
the
make
of
hi
last
two
film
-lrb-
though
thei
've
sinc
separ
-rrb-
,
is
magnet
and
energet
enough
to
plai
a
credibl
joan
-lrb-
as
long
as
you
believ
joan
wa
not
just
a
warrior
,
but
also
a
fabul
,
supermodel-level
babe
-rrb-
.

and
besson
remain
a
servic
action
film
director
,
though
not
an
especi
facil
on
.

lead
her
armi
against
the
seemingli
impenetr
fortress
of
the
english
,
joan
's
struggl
against
great
odd
is
undeni
stir
,
and
besson
help
you
understand
how
the
french
could
believ
,
fervent
,
that
god
is
on
her
side
.

besson
's
big
mistak
,
i
think
,
is
try
to
dramat
the
interior
life
of
hi
subject
.

ye
,
joan
had
vision
--
but
i
guarante
that
whatev
imag
a
sympathet
audienc
conjur
in
it
collect
mind
will
be
more
compel
than
the
blue-ei
christ
figur
on
displai
in
besson
's
hallucinatori
dream
sequenc
.

the
whole
conceit
turn
into
a
disast
right
about
the
time
dustin
hoffman
-lrb-
bill
as
``
the
conscienc
''
-rrb-
show
up
,
spout
platitud
and
send
poor
milla
run
around
her
cell
,
babbl
like
alli
mcbeal
.

that
's
kind
of
a
shame
,
sinc
she
doe
quit
well
up
to
that
point
,
charg
into
battl
with
a
banshe
wail
that
suggest
the
erupt
of
a
sublim
bloodthirsti
.

that
darkli
attract
aspect
of
her
charact
--
that
she
's
as
like
a
charismat
madwoman
as
the
vessel
of
the
lord
--
is
more
or
less
betrai
by
the
final
reel
,
in
which
the
conscienc
browbeat
her
over
the
kill
she
's
overseen
and
joan
start
to
look
like
littl
more
than
a
veri
confus
young
ladi
who
's
about
to
take
a
fall
