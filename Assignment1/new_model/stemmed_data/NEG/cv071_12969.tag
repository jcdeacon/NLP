televis
is
what
's
wrong
with
deep
impact
.

the
main
charact
,
plai
by
tea
leoni
,
is
a
low-level
broadcast
journalist
for
msnbc
-lrb-
and
that
's
the
mere
tip
of
the
product-placement
iceberg
-rrb-
who
stumbl
upon
a
huge
govern
conspiraci
.

she
think
it
's
an
instanc
of
an
ex-secretari
of
someth
or
other
-lrb-
jame
cromwel
-rrb-
resign
becaus
of
a
mistress
,
and
that
mayb
he
took
the
fall
for
the
presid
in
the
same
area
.

when
she
goe
nose
around
cromwel
,
he
beg
her
to
keep
it
under
wrap
.

``
i
know
you
're
just
a
report
,
but
you
us
to
be
a
human
be
.
''

she
figur
out
what
's
realli
go
on
after
get
rough
up
by
some
fbi
men
and
do
an
internet
search
,
where
all
good
journalist
learn
the
differ
between
a
mistress
and
an
extinct-level
comet
.

upon
a
top-secret
meet
with
presid
freeman
,
leoni
agre
to
keep
the
stori
under
wrap
until
the
presid
can
hold
a
press
confer
,
at
which
she
get
to
ask
the
first
question
.

and
everyon
know
,
if
you
get
to
ask
the
first
question
,
babi
you
're
a
star
.

leoni
end
up
in
the
anchor
chair
,
broadcast
everi
step
of
the
comet
's
collis
cours
with
earth
.

and
i
'm
sure
it
's
comfort
for
her
to
know
that
,
even
though
the
world
's
end
in
a
matter
of
month
,
she
's
a
cabl
new
person
.

so
there
she
is
,
narrat
the
six-astronaut
mission
to
blow
the
comet
up
.

such
person
as
robert
duval
,
jon
favreau
and
blair
underwood
cash
their
paycheck
and
go
through
the
motion
of
thi
drag-out
process
.

but
as
anyon
who
's
seen
the
commerci
know
,
the
astronaut
fail
.

thei
onli
end
up
break
the
comet
into
two
piec
,
which
mean
even
more
destruct
to
the
earth
.

yeah
,
thank
,
nasa
.

that
's
when
freeman
ha
to
come
on
tv
for
the
last
time
and
sai
goodby
to
all
the
peopl
who
ar
n't
pick
to
live
in
the
missouri
cave
site
for
two
year
.

thei
even
have
anim
,
two
by
two
,
readi
to
climb
into
the
cave
.

if
the
focu
had
been
on
peopl
live
insid
these
cave
after
the
world
had
been
destroi
,
deep
impact
could
have
been
a
far
more
interest
movi
.

instead
we
watch
as
a
lovestruck
elijah
wood
defi
all
odd
to
chase
down
hi
young
wife
,
while
peopl
pack
the
highwai
out
of
town
.

the
reason
is
,
of
cours
,
that
if
a
comet
is
go
to
strike
,
thei
might
as
well
be
out
in
some
scenic
rural
locat
.

and
,
amusingli
,
the
highwai
is
spot
with
peopl
in
u-haul
truck
.

i
'm
sure
it
's
comfort
to
know
that
,
even
though
the
world
's
end
in
a
matter
of
minut
,
the
u-haul
peopl
ar
do
the
most
busi
of
their
live
.
