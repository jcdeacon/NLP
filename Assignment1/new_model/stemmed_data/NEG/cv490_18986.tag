i

appreci
it
when
a

manipul
the
viewer
into
think
the
plot
is
interest
,
when
in
fact
it
's
ludicr
.

in
the
case
of
the
gener
's
daughter
,
the
plot
is
more
than
capabl
of
intrigu
you
to
a
certain
point
.

but
at
thi
junctur
in
the
stori
,
the
movi
begin
to
fall
apart
like

thi
predict
summer
thriller

sporad

and
that
is
unfortun
not
enough
to
compens
for
all
of
it

where
john

but
the
circumst

of
deliv
a

thriller
,
but
he
fail
miser
when
it
come
to
the
intellectu
part
of
it
.

the
gener
's
daughter
is
,
more
often
than
not
,
a
predict
and
unexcit
mess
.

it
doe
not
help
matter
that
the
plot
is
virtual
actionless
,
drag
it
's
heel
all
the
wai
at
a
mind-numb
snail
pace
.

a

brief

marvel

,
show
that
the
movi
could
have
deliv
such
a
more
profici
packag
.

from
a
director
who
doe
such
a
great
job
of
stage
explos
and
miracul
stunt
,
i
suggest
west
should
stick
with
mindless
,
rip-roar
action
featur
and
attempt
to
avoid
futur
project
like
thi
.

still
,
the
movi
is
certainli
not
without
it
's
merit
.

the
act
is

to

who

manag
to
hold
her
own
for
a
while
,
but
as
the
femal
lead
in
an
action-thriller
,
she
doe
n't
pull
through
suffici
.

on
of
the
problem
with
the
execut
is
that
it
's
veri
predict
.

>
from
minut
on
,
i
had
few
doubt
about
the
ident
of
the
killer
in
question
.

the
script
even
unwillingli
point
him
out
for
us
,
us
familiar
techniqu
to
hide
hi
guilt
until
the
unmask
toward
the
end
.

in
all
fair
,
we
've
seen
mani
of
the
devic
us
in
the
gener
's
daughter
put
to
greater
effect
in
other
film
.

the
secret
behind
the
girl
's
mysteri
death
ar
explain
gradual
,
but
by
the
resolut
we
have
tunnel
through
so
much
malarkei
that
it
feel
unnecessari
and
surprisingli
silli
.

the
gener
's
daughter
is
not
a
terribl
movi
,
and
it
is
involv
enough
to
sustain
a
viewer
's
attent
span
for
a
certain
period
of
time
.

but
it
just
could
have
been
so
much
better
.
