,
presid
of
the
colleg
is
none
too
happi
with
him
becaus
he
's
left
her
wait
at
the
altar
due
to
hi
lack
of
short-term
--
and
long-term
--
memori
.

she

on
more
chanc
.

he
blow
that
chanc
when
he
invent

and
is
so
excit
by
hi
discoveri
that
sara

is
onc
again
await

in
her
white
dress
.

hi
tardi
is
help
along
by
hi
jealou
fly
robot
assist
who
want
him
all
to
herself
.

it
's
not
all
bad
new
.

flubber
is
a
green
jello
that
can
magnifi
and
reflect
energi
that
is
appli
to
it
.

brainard
realiz
the
commerci
potenti
within
the
goo
can
save
the
school
from
bankruptci
and
be
taken
over
by
the
town
's
evil
industrialist
charl
hoenick
-lrb-
raymond
barri
-rrb-
.

while
he
's
busi
with
hi
new
breakthrough
,
the
slight
sweetheart
is
be
woo
by
hi
sleazi
rival
wilson
croft
-lrb-
christoph
mcdonald
-rrb-
.

there
's
a
fly
car
,
flubber-enhanc
basketbal
game
and
an
assort
of
broken
lab
equip
:
none
of
which
ar
the
least
bit
interest
or
funni
.

at
on
point
,
my
son
look
around
the
audienc
and
ask
``
why
ar
these
peopl
laugh
?
''

although
william
turn
in
on
of
hi
least
inspir
role
,
he
is
easili
the
most
live
of
the
actor
.

everyon
els
come
across
as
half-asleep
.

the
re-make
is
success
in
that
respect
.

it
feel
like
a
bad
disnei
movi
from
the
sixti
.

i
rememb
the
origin
as
be
charm
,
but
my
guess
is
that
the
memori
from
almost
four
decad
ago
ha
been
artifici
enhanc
by
the
year
.

there
have
been
some
updat
.

fred
macmurrai
's
fly
model
t
ha
been
replac
by
a
t-bird
.

hi
faith
dog
charli
is
now
``
weebo
''
,
the
hover
robot
.

the
biggest
chang
is
that
,
with
sophist
comput
anim
,
we
now
can
have
film
show
off
special
effect
without
be
at
all
entertain
.

flubber
is
anthropomorph
into
a
be
supposedli
with
person
.

the
gloop
ha
littl
arm
and
leg
and
split
into
tini
littl
gloopett
for
a
big
danc
number
.

thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
the
stori
.

the
onli
possibl
reason
is
to
creat
merchandis
opportun
so
that
kid
can
badger
their
parent
into
take
them
to
mcdonald
for
the
toi
.

not
that
contribut
littl
to
the
plot
is
a
big
problem
.

there
ar
veri
few
aspect
of
the
film
that
move
the
stori
and
those
that
do
do
n't
make
sens
.

the
discoveri
of
flubber
is
go
to
save
the
colleg
becaus
brainard
can
sell
hi
fly
car
to
ford
.

anyon
with
half
a
brain
would
be
abl
to
see
that
hi
intellig
fly
automaton
is
worth
billion
.

it
's
unbeliev
that
hi
lover
-lrb-
well
,
probabl
not
a
lover
--
after
all
thi
is
disnei
-rrb-
start
date
croft
after
the
abort
wed
.

there
's
not
on
appeal
compon
of
thi
man
.

after
the
professor
discov
that
smear
a
golf
ball
with
the
gunk
caus
it
to
bounc
uncontrol
around
hi
lab
wreak
havoc
,
i
cring
as
he
pick
up
a
bowl
ball
.

thi
gui
is
beyond
forget
,
ventur
into
the
certifi
.

look
much

featur
a
coupl
of
vapid
goon
who
get

around
and
a
cute
littl

who
scream

.

in
some
wai
,
it
's
difficult
to

i
have
a
suspicion
