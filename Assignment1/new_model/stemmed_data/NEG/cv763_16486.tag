it
us
to
be
that
not
just
anyon
could
becom
a
vampir
.

usual
,
you
had
to
be
an
aristocrat-a
count
such
as
dracula
or
karnstein
.

to
qualifi
,
you
'd
have
to
have
a
modicum
of
sophist
,
so
you
'd
at
least
look
cool-or
suav-when
bite
into
some
young
damsel
's
throat
.

but
todai
,
in
our
overli
polit
correct
world
,
ani
scuzzi-look
,
long-hair
,
unshaven
lout
or
ani
spike-hair
harridan
can
put
the
bite
on
you
.

by
the
same
token
,
to
be
a
vampir
hunter
,
on
had
to
have
some
sort
of
medic
train
and
knowledg
of
the
occult
or
mayb
perhap
be
some
sort
of
profession
soldier
,
or
at
least
on
who
retir
with
honor
.

not
in
these
time
.

all
you
need
ar
some
sharp
weapon
,
some
bullet
forg
from
silver
and
ani
yahoo
can
be
a
buffi-or
a
blade
.

without
sound
elitist
,
the
fear
of
vampir
ha
greatli
diminish
becaus
of
thi
lack
of
exclus
.

which
bring
us
to
blade
,
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
vampir
movi
in
which
,
it
seem
,
half
the
popul
is
put
the
bite
on
the
other
half
.

not
onli
ar
there
thousand
of
vampir
,
but
thei
seem
to
move
from
citi
to
citi
,
pai
off
polic
depart
and
,
most
importantli
,
establish
their
own
exclus
after-hour
rave
in
which
the
highlight
is
the
sprinkler
system
go
off
and
dous
all
the
occup
in
a
blood
shower
.

with
all
that
blood
,
you
wonder
why
thei
have
to
hunt
for
victim
.

you
also
wonder
when
thei
get
the
time
to
get
their
cloth
dry-clean
and
why
no
cleaner
ever
complain
about
all
the
bloodstain
.

blade
,
which
is
base
on
a
marvel
comic
book
charact
,
is
,
like
a
comic
book
,
all
visual
.

the
plot
is
basic
blade
repetiti
slash
hi
wai
through
the
vampir
armi
seek
their
leader
,
deacon
frost
.

it
's
all
hokum
and
nonsens
,
of
cours
.

but
the
filmmak
plai
it
straight
.

unfortun
,
at
least
at
the
advanc
screen
i
attend
,
the
audienc
did
n't
see
it
that
wai
and
laugh
through
much
of
the
proceed
.

you
know
a
movi
is
in
troubl
when
the
scene
of
blood
and
gore
that
should
elicit
scream
of
fright
instead
evok
peel
of
laughter
.

anoth
tell-tale
sign
is
when
the
audienc
seem
to
be
admir
the
hero
's
costum
more
than
the
hero
.

also
it
seem
it
's
not
enough
for
todai
's
vampir
mere
to
have
fang
.

he
must
also
be
profici
in
the
martial
art
.

why
a
supernatur
be
,
on
of
the
undead
,
need
such
skill
is
beyond
me
.

-lrb-
of

to
the
1974
hammer
film-run

shaw
product
of
legend
of
the

in
which
dracula
is
defeat
by

if

is
just
anoth
exampl
of
how
the
vampir
film
,
a
onc
honor
member
of
the
horror
famili
,
ha
gone
downhil

thi
dud
mostli
make
you
yearn
for
those
quaint
old
dai
when
christoph
lee
could
be
stop
just
by
dangl
a
crucifix
in

face
.

todai
's
vampir
lack
the
panach
,
the
style
of
a
bela
lugosi
or
a
christoph
lee
.

thei
ar
not
even
worthi
enough
to
carri
those
great
bloodsuck

thei
ar
more
farcic
than
fright

thi
whole
enterpris
is
on
dull

that
could
have
