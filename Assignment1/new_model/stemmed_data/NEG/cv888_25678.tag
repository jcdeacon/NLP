and
it
's
becaus
of
their
presenc
that
i
watch
thi

in
the
first
place
.

howev
,
not
long
into
the
proceed
i
want
to
just
reach
into
the
film
and
strangl
them
both
.

i
should
n't
have
such
feel
toward
peopl
i
like
,
but
their
charact
ar
so
infuri
that
...
well
trust
me
,
you
'll
feel
the
same
wai
.

even
though
both
of
the
lead
male
charact
ar
usual
in
the
wrong
,
kellei
is
hand
down
the
more
unlik
of
the
two
,
simpli
becaus
hi
jerkish
action
ar
calcul
.

he
