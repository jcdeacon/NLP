but
right
in

,
thei
throw
in
a
complet
un-relat
plot

.

dietl

film
spend
over
half
an

onc

back
to

asid
from

-lrb-
an
insult
if
you
ask
me
-rrb-
the
perform
were
pretti
good
.

baldwin
,
though
he
occasion
slip
into
an
impress
of
hi
brother
alec
,
doe
a
fine
job
as
on
tough
cop
.

penn
,
who
also
slip
into
an
impress
of
hi
brother
sean
,
is
even
better
as
a
loser
tough
gui
cop
.

what
on
tough
cop
lack
is
origin
.

thi
film
offer
noth
new
.

noth
that
you
ca
n't
get
from
ani
cop
film
.

it
scream
sidnei
lumet
all
over
the
place
,
perhap
becaus
it
wa
produc
by
marti
and
michael
bregman
,
produc
of
lumet
's
dog
dai
afternoon
and
serpico
.

but
even
the
master
sidnei
would
not
have
been
abl
to
make
on
tough
cop
into
a
good
film
.

too
much
els
is
lack
.

i
also
saw
the
boom
mic
pop
into
the
top
of
the
frame
twice
earli
on
in
the
pictur
,
someth
that
i
almost
never
notic
.

but
onc
i
saw
that
,
i
had
it
in
the
back
of
my
mind
everi
time
i
saw
a
medium
or
long
shot
.

at
time
,
i
wa
hope
to
see
it
.

on
tough
cop
is
n't
laughabl
,
nor
is
it
a
terribl
film
,
but
it
just
is
n't
uniqu
.

it
is
a
classic
exampl
of
a
film
that
did
n't
need
to
be
made
.

but
on
thing
is
for
sure
,
it
could
realli
us
a
better
titl
.
