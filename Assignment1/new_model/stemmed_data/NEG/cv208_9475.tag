at
least
on
would
hope
so
.

on
would
be
serious
incorrect
.

eugen
sand
-lrb-
duchovni
-rrb-
is
a
surgeon
so
dedic
to
hi
craft
that
he
becom
addict
to
amphetamin
to

it
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
plan
when
he
lose
a
patient
and
hi
licens
while
under
the
influenc
.

ten
month
later
,
in
a
seedi
bar
to
score

the

get
a
chanc
to

timothi
hutton
-rrb-
is
impress
with
the
cutleri
skill
on
hi
associ
.

he
kidnap
and
then
offer
down-and-out
eugen
a
posit
in
hi
organ
.

blossom
need
a
doctor
to
patch
up
gunshot
victim
that
would
be
problemat
at
a
hospit
.

sand
's
temptat
is
that
thi
will
give
him
a
chanc
to
practic
medicin
again
albeit
illeg
,
big
chunk
of
cash
to

and
close
proxim
to
the
gangster
's
womanfriend
clair
-lrb-
angelina
joli
-rrb-
,
thi
film
's
babe
factor
.

the
would-be
big
time
oper
is
desper
in
need
of
help
.

on
the
run
from
russian
mobster
-lrb-
the
bad
gui
that
seem
to
be
all
the
rage
in
thi
year
's
film
-rrb-
and
try
to
cut
a
pirat
softwar
deal
with
the
chines
mafia
,
blossom
is
surround
by
blood
.

after
a
few
medic
misadventur
,
the
physician
grow
disench
with
hi
employ
.

an
encount
with
a
coupl
of
psycho
surfer
dude
who
threaten
to
blow
him
awai
unless
he
``
fix
''
their
dead
buddi
cement
hi
feel
that
he
is
in
the
wrong
line
of
work
.

when
the
fbi
visit
and
forc
him
to
becom
an
inform
,
there
is
no
question
that
he
need
to
be
somewher
els
.

oddli
enough
,
these
seem
like
thei
could
be
excit
scene
.

the
film
disprov
that
assumpt
.

then
a
bunch
of
other
uninterest
thing
happen
.

write
thi
onli
two
dai
after
see
the
film
,
it
a
struggl
to
rememb
the
event
.

you
can
take
that
as
a
solid
lack
of
recommend
.

for
all
the
cool
that
duchovni
exhibit
in
``
x-file
''
,
it
's
a
surpris
that
hi
big
screen
presenc
is
so
lack
in
charisma
.

the
doctor
is
particularli
bland
and
dull
.

even
the
cold
turkei
bit
which
is
rife
with
dramat
possibl
come
across
as
banal
.

a
littl
chocol
and
minor
sweat
get
him
through
heroin
withdraw
.

like
virtual
everyth
els
in
the
film
,
it
's
a
miss
opportun
.

the
fox
mulder
detach
doe
n't
work
here
.

oscar-winner
hutton
's
manic
mobster
is
much
more
difficult
to
get
a
handl
on
.

plai
partial
for
comedi
and
partial
as
craze
killer
,
blossom
almost
becom
real
,
but
then
sink
into
goofi
.

most
of
the
time
hutton
look
as
if
he
's
search
for
hi
charact
and
come
up
empti
.

joli
also
make
a
few
fals
move
toward
creat
a
three-dimension
human
be
befor
give
up
and
turn
into
sceneri
.

the
most
interest
aspect
of
her
perform
is
watch
her
pouti
lip
threaten
to
take
over
the
screen
.

the
rest
ar
n't
ani
better
.

michael

of

hi
