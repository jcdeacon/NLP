about

,
to
exact
reveng
on
those
who
screw

helgeland
's
film
-lrb-
which
wa
recut
by
mel
the
produc
-rrb-
is
devoid
of
an
imper
dime

's
the
termin
strand
in
a
plot
without
a
sci-fi
hook
to
keep
us
interest
after
the
initi
sadist
thrill
is
gone
.

payback
should
have
been
call
playback
:
it
's
a
102-minut
loop
of
the
same
short
sequenc
.

-rrb-

it
's
not
porter
's
singl-minded
that
rob
the
film
of
snap
,
crackl
,
and
pop
;
as
a
charact
who
ha
alreadi
``

onc
,
he
ha
noth
to
lose
and
so
much
to
gain
.

the
movi
lack
danger
.

the
onli
thing
porter
is
in
jeopardi
of
is
put
the
audienc
to
sleep
.

payback
ha
a
gritti
,
metal
look
to
it
that
also
becom
monoton
;
it
cinematographi
would
be
more
appropri
in
on
of
those
bleak
urban
psychodrama
that
come
out
of
england
everi
coupl

-rrb-

to
analyz
such
mediocr
is
to
grant
payback
far
more
attent
