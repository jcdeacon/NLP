.

although
comparison
can
be
made
with
thi
film
to
deliver
-lrb-
1972
-rrb-
and
the
vanish
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
plot
wise
,
the
latter
two
ar
far
superior
charact
and
script
wise
.

kurt
russel
is
o.k
as
jeff
,
although
he
can
seemingli
onli
pull
of
on
express
,
which
is
angri
.

throughout
the
whole
film
,
he
look
angri
-lrb-
or
just
piss
off
.
-rrb-

throughout
the
whole
film
,
she
look
dorki
.

j.t
walsh
-lrb-
who
,
sadli
,
recent
pass
awai
-rrb-
is
fine
as
warren
-lrb-
who
we
soon
find
out
is
a
kidnapp
-rrb-
although
hi
actual
charact
is
pretti
weak
,
and
not
realli
menac
enough
.

the
support
cast
do
their
best
aswel
,
with
rex
linn
as
a
doubt
sheriff
,
and
the
other
kidnapp
.

the
stori
,
written
by
first-timer
jonathan
mostow
-lrb-
who
also
direct
-rrb-
is
o.k
,
if
surprisingli
familiar
and
sometim
extraordinarili
stupid
.

some
of
the
thing
the
charact
do
in
thi
movi
is
beyond
the
bound
of
idioci
.

there
ar
some
flaw
with
the
plot
also
,
as
the
charact
do
the
complet
opposit
to
logic
-lrb-
presum
to
keep
the
stori
'
excit
'
-rrb-
and
also
the
fact
that
the
stori
just
is
n't
strong
enough
to
sustain
the
audienc
's
attent
.

the
pictur
move
along
veri
slowli
also
.

it
almost
threaten
to
drop
dead
.

the
pictur
doe
pick
up
toward
the
end
,
but
by
then
it
's
too
late
.

mostow
direct
the
action
sequenc
well
enough
,
howev
.

the
film
doe
n't
realli
come
to
a
satisfi
conclus
,
either
.

the
end
tri
to
be
bleak
,
but
just
come
off
annoi
.

breakdown
could
of
been
a
far
more
enjoy
pictur
had
it
had
a
stronger
cast
and
director
.

instead
,
it
just
turn
out
to
be
mere
averag
.

a
miss
opportun
.
