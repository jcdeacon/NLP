to

into
a

to
which
the

inevit
go

after

where

there
's
no

the

upon

thei
arriv

where
thei
ar
believ
to
be
two

rather
than
slink

disappoint

-rrb-
.

yellowston
ha
a
problem
.

it
's
onli
a
week
befor
the
famou
geyser
old
faith
celebr
it
on
billionth
birthdai
,
and
the
park
is
be
overrun
with
prairi
dog
.

not
just
on
or
two
...
thousand
of
them
.

the
deedl
ar
assign

menac
,
not

that
it
all
is
part
of
a
fiendish
plan
by
disgrac
former
head
ranger
frank
slater
-lrb-
denni
hopper
-rrb-
.

the
brother
deedl
ar
n't
suppos
to
be
out-and-out
stupid
,
like
the
team
from
dumb
and
dumber
,
or
bill
and
ted
.

instead
,
their
brain
just
oper
in
a
differ
,
simpler
,
realm
.

a
more
accur
comparison
would
be
with
carrot
top
in
chairman
of
the
board
,
a
film
which
,
unfortun
,
thi
on
resembl
in
sever
hideou
wai
.

the
central
problem
with
meet
the
deedl
is
that
it
simpli
just
is
n't
funni
.

there
's
a
moment
when
phil
utter
the
line
,
``
insert
laugh
here
''
,
which
nearli
sum
up
the
entir
meet
the
deedl
experi
.

the
result
is
n't
bad
in
a
run-shriek-from-the-theater
type
of
wai
.

instead
,
it
's
mere
bad
in
an
excruciatingli
bore
sort
of
wai
.

the
cast
seem
decent
,
but
thei
're
never
ask
to
do
anyth
remot
interest
.

instead
,
the
film
inund
the
audienc
with
countless
shot
of
peopl
and/or
car
roll
downhil
in
the
forest
,
and
with
constant
annoi
refer
to
other
disnei
film
.

you
'll
have
much
better
luck
find
a
good
spot
to
surf
in
wyom
than
find
entertain
in
meet
the
deedl
.
