the

ha

hi
constant
quip
mai
be
a
bit
over-written
,
but
thei
manag
to
captur
the
same
vein
of
nerv-addl
humor
that
bill
paxton
deliv
as
hudson
in
alien
-lrb-
or
todd
graff
as
hippi
in

,
for
that
matter
-rrb-

it
's
just
a
stock
part
-lrb-
the
comic-relief
charact
-rrb-
,

it
almost
make
thi
tire
alien
clone
bearabl

as
far
as
the
monster
goe
,
although
the
cgi
is
done
well
,
the
creatur
ha
no
logic
consist
.

think
back
to
the
great
-lrb-
or
even
just
good
-rrb-
movi
monster
.

thei
all
had
a
set
of
``
rule
''
about
what
thei
could
do
,
and
how
and
why
thei
would
do
it
.

part
of
the
joi
of
those
film
wa
slowli
discov
,
along
with
the
hero
,
just
what
those
rule
ar
.

the
tentacl
monster
in
deep
rise
doe
n't
have
a
set
of
rule
...
or
if
it
doe
,
not
a

good
on
.

it
mere
eat
-lrb-
or
drink
,
as
the
case
mai
be
-rrb-
,
and
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason
for
what
it
doe
in
order
to
do
so
.

the
film
never
explain
why
the
argonauticu
is
attack
in
the
first
place
.

it
simpli
happen

the
action
scene
ar
decent

the

unfortun

deep

on

plu
side

howev
,
the

perhap
