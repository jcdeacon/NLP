but
not
even
their
guilti

is
n't
enough
to
carri
their
big

debut
,
a
junki

which
would
be
more
aptli

a

is

wrong
.

it
's
all
downhil
from
there
as
spice
world
collaps
into
a
seri
of
misfir
comedi
sketch
.

i
must
give
the
girl
credit
for
their
refresh
willing
to
make
fun
of
themselv
,
but
writer
kim
fuller
and
director
bob
spier
can
bare
come
up
with
a
funni
joke
between
them
,
much
less
a
organ
framework
for
all
the
``
wacki
''
go-on
.

spice

jump
from
vignett
to
vignett
,
subplot
to
subplot
with
no
direct
and
littl
sens
,
at
on
minut
have
the
girl
meet
with
alien
-lrb-
no
joke
-rrb-
and
at
anoth
have
them
stage
a
dare
rescu
of
two
young
fan
who
fall
into
the
water
dure
a
boat
ride
.

while
a
decent
joke
slip
through
the
crack
here
and
there
--
dure
a
``
danc
bootcamp
''
scene
,
the
girl
sing
the
lyric
``
we
know
how
we
got
thi
far/strength
and
courag
and
a
wonderbra
''
--
much
of
the
materi
is
not
even
funni
on
the
chuckl
level
.

some
gag
ar
just
plain
pointless
,
such
as
roger
moor
's
recur
role
as
the
mysteri
chief
,
who
dispens
cryptic

metaphor-heavi

the
onli
reason
why
i
can
think
anyon
would
find
that
funni
is
the
fact
that
moor

as
weak
as
the
script
is
,
i
think
there
's
on
insurmount
problem
with
even
attempt
to
make
a
spice

movi
,
and
that
is
the
girl
themselv
.

the

is
not

,
for

that

which
work
as

over

ar

the

the

is
as
grate
as

the
energi
of
the

give

a
much-need
shot
