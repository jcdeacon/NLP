the

to
let

know
that

numer

and
after

you

thi
is
a
terribl
film
that
is
illog
construct
,
tedious
act
,
and
frequent
beg
the
question
:
why
wa
thi
ever
made
?

at
a
price
tag
of
$
90
million
,
thi
film
will
be
rememb
as
a
gigant
folli
,
assuredli
becom
`
the
aveng
'
of
thi
summer
.

both
film
were
unforgiv
and
thi
promis
to
suffer
the
same
speedi
fate
and
subsequ
indign
.

in
addit
to
the
univers
pejor
review
,
there
's
anoth
bizarr
element
to
the
`
battlefield
'
saga
.

thi
film
would
never
have
been
made
if
not
for
the
star
power
of
travolta
,
who
for
over
a
decad
,
had
been
try
to
persuad
studio
to
bring
the
stori
to
the
big
screen
.

the
controversi
is
that
travolta
is
a
scientologist
,
and
`
battlefield
'
is
base
on
a
1982
novel
by
l.
ron
hubbard
,
the
religion
's
late
founder
.

thi
led
some
to
believ
that
`
battlefield
earth
'
would
amount
to
scientologist
dogma
,
laden
with
sublimin
messag
.

but
the
stori
is
so
poorli
told
that
ani
messag
,
sublimin
or
otherwis
,
is
total
undetect
.

if
the
audienc
got
anyth
out
of
thi
film
,
it
wa
thi
:
we
ar
not
too
unlik
the
psychlo
leader
.

like
terl
,
the
audienc
felt
imprison
,
dread
their
situat
,
and
look
for
ani
opportun
to
leav
.

could
that
be
the
scientolog
messag
?
