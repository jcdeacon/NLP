movi
do
n't
come
much
more
ridicul
titl
than
``
i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
,
''
but
sinc
the
movi
in
question
is
best
describ
as
ridicul
,
the
titl
sort
of
work
as
a
warn
.

more
than
a
silli-sound
mouth
to
blurt
out
to
the
ticket
vendor
,
thi
horror
sequel
's
monik
also
contain
a
grievou
oversight
that
anyon
who
saw
the
origin
will
be
abl
to
spot
:
what
``
you
''
did
_
last
_
summer
``
you
''
actual
did
the
summer
_
befor
_
last
summer
,
and
sinc
``
i
''
knew
about
it
_
thi
_
summer
as
well
as
_
last
_
summer
,
it
's
realli
illog
to
sai
that
``
i
''
_
still
_
know
what
``
you
''
did
_
last
_
summer
.

the
filmmak
would
have
at
least
made
sens
with
the
shorter
``
i
still
know
,
''
the
longer
``
i
still
know
what
you
did
two
summer
ago
''
or
the
appropri
``
stupid
peopl
get
hack
to
bit
.
''

that
last
suggest
is
the
prefer
on
sinc
the
charact
in
thi
film
do
thing
that
ar
the
polar
opposit
of
smart
.

for
exampl
,
if
your
roommat
is
plagu
by
terribl
nightmar
as
a
result
of
be
stalk
and
nearli
murder
not
long
ago
,
would
you
sneak
into
her
room
late
at
night
and
hide
in
the
closet
,
even
if
it
wa
just
to
locat
and
borrow
a
cute
littl
dress
?

probabl
not
,

that
's
precis

the
