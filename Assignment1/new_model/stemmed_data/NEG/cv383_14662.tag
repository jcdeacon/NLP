it
's

fun
of

the

anyon
want
to
place
a
wager
on
hi
final
decis
?

the
on
genuin
asset
in
``
holi

''
is
eddi
murphi
,
who
give
a
charm
perform
,
share
love
,
good
will
and
relev
advic
to
all
those
around
him
,
while
beam

smile
at
just
the
right
moment
.

murphi
is
delight
and
the
film
take
off
whenev
he
's
onscreen
.

unfortun
,
he
's
not
onscreen
enough
.

jeff

get
the
lion
's

of
screen
time
and
hi
tire
storylin
weigh
the
proceed
down

as
hi

love

,
kelli

tri
to
brighten
thing
up
,
but
she
transform
from
an
all-busi
media
shark
to
an
empath
softi
far
too
quickli
and
the
abrupt
chang
reek
of

the
other
princip
actor
,
robert
loggia
,
wast
hi
talent
in
a
on-note
turn
as
a
ruthless
,
scream
monster
.

structur
unsound
and
wai
too
long
,
``
holi
man
''
is
appeal
when
murphi
is
onscreen
and
dull
when
he
is
n't
.

instead
of
drop
your
monei
at
the
theater
for
thi
trifl
,
wait
until
it
hit
video
and
fast-forward
past
everyth
except
the
murphi
scene
.

g
suggest
that
we
focu
on
enjoi
the
moment
and
that
's
the
best
wai
to
do
so
.
