and
movi
screensav
,

is
written
by
the
man
who
is
deem
to
be
``
on
of
the
hottest
writer
in
hollywood
''
.

he
wrote
the
groundbreak
screenplai
for
scream
,
then
ad
the
success
i
know
what
you
did
last
summer
script
to
hi
mix
,
and
also
creat
the
popular
tv
seri
``
dawson
's
creek
''
.

so
when
he
ask
to
direct
hi
first
movi
,
base
on
hi
first
ever
script
written
,
everyon
and
their
grandma
said
``
sure
,
go
for
it
!
''
.

uhhm
,
my
question
is
...
did
anyon
bother
read
thi
stupid
script
???
ac
student
leigh
ann
watson
is
mistakenli
caught
with
some
cheat
paper
by
the
bitchiest
teacher
in
the
west
,
mr.
tingl
,
and
set
to
lose
her
scholarship
to
colleg
.

when
she
and
her
friend
visit
the
teacher
at
home
in
order
to
explain
their
side
of
the
stori
,
thei
end
up
ty
her
up
,
and
slowli
try
to
talk
some
sens
into
the
hardhead
woman
.

it
's
not
so
much
that
thi
is
a
bad
movi
,
than
the
fact
that
it
suck
.

thi
movi
is
chock-full
of
on-dimension
charact
,
contain
no
actual
humor
that
i
wa
abl
to
zone
in
on
,
zero
tension
or
thrill
,
plot
hole
the
size
of
my
big
ass
,
lame
pop
tune
plai
to
mask
noth
go
on
in
the
movi
,
and
molli
ringwald
,
vivica
a.
fox
and
leslei
ann
warren
toss
awai
in
throwawai
role
.

i
wa
prime
for
thi
film
as
it
interest
premis
had
me
think
miseri
and
9
to
5
,
but
unfortun
for
williamson
,
he
went
nowher
with
the
bright
foundat
,
make
refer
to
the
exorcist
and
dr.
zhivago
,
which
i
doubt
mani
in
hi
target
market
will
appreci
.

he
also
forgot
about
suspens
,
with
all
of
hi
charact
base
on
incomprehens
decis
,
unbeliev
motiv
and
simpli
bore
us
with
all
of
their
trite
dialogu
.

sure
,
kati
holm
is
cute
,
and
her
co-star
,
marisa
coughlan
,
did
a
reason
amus
impress
of
the
exorcist
-lrb-
worth
two
point
out
of
my
three
on
ten
-rrb-
,
but
how
can
we
forgiv
the
biggest
on-dimension
charact
in
ani
film
,
holm
'
rival
in
the
film
,
mr.
tingl
's
complet
unprofession
be
let
go
by
all
other
around
her
-lrb-
ar
teacher
allow
to
behav
that
wai
nowadai
?
-rrb-

and
a
transpar
romanc
between
holm
and
some
long-hair
dude
,
hire
to
be
the
poor
man
's
version
of
skeet
ulrich
-lrb-
who
himself
is
a
poor
man
's
version
of
johnni
depp
!
-rrb-
.

all
in
all
,
thi
movi
wa
laughabl
for
me
,
provid
me
with
no
insight
into
anyth
,
demonstr
williamson
's
genuin
lack
of
directori
skill
alongsid
a
juvenil
script
,
and
provid
helen
mirren
with
a
great
role
to
chew
into
,
unfortun
forget
to
give
her
charact
ani
believ
,
human
or
capac
to
comprehend
.

no
hip
line
,
no
cheap
thrill
,
just
a
dull
time
at
the
movi
theater
.
