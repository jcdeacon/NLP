ani
movi
that
kill
emilio
estevez
off
in
the
first
fifteen
minut
ha
someth
go
for
it
.

unfortun
,
thi
and
the
familiar
theme
music
ar
the
onli
worthwhil
thing
about
mission
imposs
,
direct
by
brian
depalma
.

the
first
problem
is
that
thi
film
ha
absolut
no
connect
with
the
tv
show
whatsoev
,
asid
from
the
music
.

the
tv
show
wa
about
an
imposs
mission
forc
whose
deft
teamwork
,
orchestr
by
jim
phelp
,
allow
them
to
counfound
evil
dictat
of
mythic
banana
republ
from
inflict
their
sordid
scheme
upon
the
world
.

teamwork
wa
the
kei
.

thi
film
is
set
up
as
a
cross
between
jame
bond
and
depalma
's
``
blow
out
,
''
where
the
john
travolta
charact
wa
the
victim
of
real
and
imagin
conspiraci
from
all
direct
.

it
wa
travolta
's
vulner
that
made
that
film
so
excit
and
claustrophob
.

in
thi
film
,
tom
cruis
is
basic
omnisci
-lrb-
believ
that
?
-rrb-

and
so
there
's
no
fun
go
on
here
whatsoev
.

the
stori
is
about
as
contriv
as
contriv
get
,
and
is
full
of
hole
.

there
ar
basic
two
memor
sequenc
:
on
involv
break
into
a
kubrickesqu
comput
room
--
a
task
that
could
have
been
made
much
easier
had
the
charact
a
whit
of
common
sens
-lrb-
suffic
it
to
sai
that
the
alarm
system
is
disengag
when
the
comput
oper
is
in
the
room
-rrb-
;
the
second
involv
a
high-speed
train
,
a
helicopt
,
and
the
chunnel
and
doe
not
have
to
be
seen
to
be
disbeliev
.

the
actor
ar
all
miscast
,
especi
emannuel
beart
as
jim
phelp
wife
,
who
can
not
act
,
and
ving
rhame
as
a
comput
hacker
-lrb-
!
-rrb-

,
who
look
lost
and
embarras
to
be
in
thi
movi
.

tom
cruis
is
no
jame
bond
,
and
jon
voight
look
more
like
bobbi
``
the
brain
''
heenan
than
jim
phelp
.

brian
depalma
's
career
ha
been
bafflingli
errat
.

at
hi
best
,
he
beat
hitchcock
at
hi
own
game
-lrb-
``
blow
out
,
''
``
carri
,
''
``
bodi
doubl
''
-rrb-
but
thi
is
not
hi
best
.

the
screenplai
wa
partli
written
by
robert
town
,
who
wrote
the
best
scenario
of
the
seventi
in
``
chinatown
,
''
but
thi
script
is
perfunctori
at
best
,
and
terrribl
at
worst
.

the
cinematographi
ha
a
comic
book
red/blue
emphasi
,
which
is
nice
to
look
at
,
but
the
suspens
sequenc
ar
all
telegraph
and
thi
movi
even
featur
the
old
``
killer
who
talk
too
much
befor
shoot
thu
give
the
victim
time
to
think
of
an
escap
''
trick
.

pleas
do
n't
spend
your
monei
on
thi
;
it
'll
onli
encourag
hollywood
to
make
more
.
