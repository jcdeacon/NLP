word
i
thought
i
'd
never
write
:
the
sequel
to
urban
legend
lack
the
grace
,
wit
,
and
power
of
the
origin
.

put
the
gun
to
my
head
,
pull
the
trigger
,
and
put
me
out
of
my
miseri
.

better
yet
,
put
the
horror
genr
out
of
it
miseri
.

when
you
've
finish
watch
urban
legend
:
final
cut
,
you
'll
share
my
same
grim
point
of
view
thank
to
the
horribl
act
,
terribl
script
,
and
ridicul
direct
which
ha
becom
all
too
common
todai
.

urban
legend
:
final
cut
is
a
smorgasbord
of
stolen
movi
idea
-lrb-
mainli
from
the
blair
witch
project
and
scream
-rrb-
:
fabul
peopl
with
perfect
teeth
and
skin
,
on
creepi
film
school
,
and
a
dog
eat
a
freshli
remov
kidnei
from
on
of
the
movi
's
hapless
victim
.

urban
legend
deliv
a
stori
about
a
bunch
of
film
student
work
on
their
thesi
film
to
win
the
covet
``
hitchcock
award
''
which
guarante
the
winner
a
director
deal
in
hollywood
.

on
femal
filmmak
-lrb-
jennif
morrison
,
the
freaki
dead
girl
from
stir
of
echo
-rrb-
write
a
fiction
script
base
on
a
serial
killer
who
kill
hi
victim
accord
to
``
urban
legend
''
tale
.

suddenli
,
her
entir
crew
start
get
bump
off
with
urban-legendari
homicid
,
but
the
bodi
ar
alwai
miss
and
she
is
often
the
onli
wit
to
the
kill
.

the
killer
wear
a
fenc
mask
and
a
long
black
overcoat
,
look
like
a
scorn
olympian
out
to
aveng
hi
defeat
in
sydnei
.

why
thi
is
scari
is
never
explain
.

of
cours
,
the
golden
rule
of
sequel
is
that
there
must
be
least
on
recur
charact
for
continu
's
sake
.

urban
legend
ha
on
minor
,
recur
charact
from
the
origin
who
we
never
care
about
anywai
-lrb-
the
secur
guard
,
of
all
peopl
-rrb-
.

the
other
central
problem
is
that
thi
charact
ha
alreadi
seen
the
urban
legend
kill
onc
befor
,
but
she
's
utterli
clueless
about
what
's
go
on
around
her
.

call
it
suspens
of
disbelief
.

thi
film
is
also
a
prime
exampl
of
how
horror
film
ar
now
complet
dead
in
the
water
.

the
last
decent
horror
film
wa
the
blair
witch
project
,
and
that
seem
more
like
a
snuff
film
than
fiction
.

the
stalk
killer
with
crazi
motiv
ha
becom
a
tire
clich
,
as
everyon
seem
to
have
forgotten
:
real
horror
is
not
about
what
is
seen
but
about
what
is
unknown
.
