eddi
murphi
ha
a
lot
ride
on
harlem
night
.

as
the
movi
's
writer
,
director
,
execut
produc
,
and
star
,
murphi
will
shoulder
all
of
the
blame
if
harlem
night
fail
.

but
at
the
same
time
,
he
'll
receiv
all
of
the
credit
if
it
succe
.

should
you
sacrific
your
hard-earn
cash
to
support
murphi
's
riski
gambl
?

well
,
that
depend
on
whom
you
trust
more
:
me
or
eddi
murphi
.

here
's
what
murphi
think
:
``
i
think
the
audienc
is
expect
a
good
time
.
''

thei
gon
na
get
sexi
.

thei
gon
na
get
funni
.

thei
gon
na
get
drama
.

thei
gon
na
get
all
of
that
.

i
think
it
's
the
best
movi
i
've
done
''
-lrb-
paramount
radio
network
-rrb-
.
''

here
's
what
i
think
:
harlem
night
is
charmless
,
unorigin
,
disappoint
,
and
almost
without
question
,
the
worst
film
of
the
actor
's
career
-lrb-
i
have
n't
seen
best
defens
-rrb-
.

and
guess
who
's
to
blame
?!

the
movi
's
problem
is
not
murphi
's
direct
:
harlem
night
is
a
fairli
good
look
film
.

no
,
the
project
wa
probabl
doom
even
befor
the
camera
roll
.

murphi
's
aw
script
is
the
culprit
.

let
's
count
the
mistak
he
make
in
hi
first
attempt
at
screenwrit
:
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
murphi
shatter
the
record
for
the
most
profan
in
a
motion
pictur
.

ye
,
he
even
outdo
hi
own
work
in
raw
.

practic
everi
line
of
dialogu
in
harlem
night
contain
at
least
on
four
letter
word
.

and
after
15
minut
,
it
get
irrit
.

-lrb-
2
-rrb-
murphi
wast
the
talent
of
hi
fine
cast
.

richard
pryor
,
redd
foxx
,
michael
lerner
,
and
della
rees
face
the
imposs
task
of
carv
out
credibl
charact
from
a
script
riddl
with
stereotyp
.

each
of
them
shine
occasion
,
but
basic
what
we
have
ar
good
perform
stuck
in
a
bad
vehicl
.

-lrb-
3
-rrb-
the
movi
demean
women
by
depict
them
sole
as
sexual
object
and
as
pawn
in
power
struggl
between
men
.

murphi
ha
admit
in
interview
that
he
is
weari
of
women
in
hi
privat
life
,
which
is
realli
neither
here
nor
there
.

but
when
murphi
put
hi
bitter
feel
on
3,000
movi
screen
across
the
countri
,
it
's
anoth
matter
altogeth
.

you
're
forc
to
swallow
some
pretti
gruesom
stuff
.

for
instanc
,
murphi
punch
della
rees
in
the
stomach
.

and
he
shoot
jasmin
gui
in
the
head
.

thi
is
a
mean-spirit
movi
,
folk
!

love
newcom
lela
rochon
get
off
easi
in
her
role
as
a
common
whore
,
but
onli
becaus
she
doe
n't
have
ani
scene
with
murphi
.

thank
god
:
he
might
have
run
her
over
with
a
bulldoz
.

-lrb-

-rrb-
murphi
ha
written
for
himself
perhap
hi
blandest
role
to
date
.

the
loveabl
eddi
murphi
charisma
emerg
onli
onc
or
twice
dure
the
film
.

murphi
would
rather
give
hi
charact
a
spiffi
wardrob
than
a
spiffi
person
.

sometim
it
seem
as
if
murphi
made
harlem
night
just
so
he
could
wear
fanci
suit
and
look
debonair
.

-lrb-
5
-rrb-
the
plot
is
a
shameless
rip-off
of
the
sting
.

if
you
're
go
to
make
anoth
sting
movi
,
you
've
got
to
do
someth
origin
.

murphi
's
tale
of
war
nightclub
owner
in
harlem
-lrb-
circa
1938
-rrb-
fail
to
add
anyth
new
to
the
formula
.

-lrb-
6
-rrb-
to
get
laugh
,
murphi
make
fun
of
stutter
.

you
know
a
comedi
is
dig
deep
when
it
resort
to
ridicul
the
handicap
.

-lrb-

-rrb-
murphi
's
idea
of
drama
is
a
scene
in
which
hi
charact
apolog
for
the
first
time
in
hi
life
.

for
what
?

for
shoot
rees
's
littl
toe
off
!

needless
to
sai
,
murphi
show
littl
,
if
ani
,
promis
or
imagin
as
a
screenwrit
.

in
all
fair
,
howev
,
a
few
rai
of
sunshin
do
manag
to
break
through
the
gloomi
cloud
surround
the
movi
.

danni
aiello
is
fun
to
watch
as
a
dirti
cop
on
the
take
.

aiello
stand
out
in
the
larg
,
ensembl
cast
:
he
obvious
relish
the
opportun
to
plai
such
a
nasti
charact
-lrb-
a
racist
detect
with
mob
ti
-rrb-
.

aiello
's
zesti
perform
give
harlem
night
some
much
need
spice
.

anoth
bright
spot
is
arsenio
hall
,
who
ha
a
hilari
,
show-stop
cameo
as
a
cry-babi
gangster
;
hall
virtual
steal
the
spotlight
from
murphi
.

in
fact
,
hall
's
ten
minut
on
screen
ar
the
funniest
ten
minut
in
the
movi
.

unfortun
,
hi
charact
is
complet
irrelev
to
the
plot
;
murphi
should
have
given
hall
a
much
bigger
role
.

of
cours
,
i
've
alreadi
mention
that
i
did
n't
care
for
murphi
's
charact
,
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
did
love
hi
neckti
.

thei
ar
simpli
spectacular
--
almost
worth
the
price
of
admiss
.
