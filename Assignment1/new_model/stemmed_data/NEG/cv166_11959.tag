unknown
to

the
audienc
,
there
is
an
evil
doctor
stowawai
determin
to
sabotag
the
entir

dr.

by
a

of

conspir

turn
the
expedit

,
and
dr.
smith
ha
re-program
a
talk
robot
to
``

!

when
everyth
that
could
go
wrong
doe
go
wrong
for
both
side
,
the
spaceship
is
warp
to
an
unknown
destin
,
and
now
the
premis
of
be
lost
in
space
is
complet
.

as
for
the
audienc
,
you
will
like
be
lost
in
boredom
by
thi
point
,
wonder
if
the
plot
,
like
the
jupit
2
,
will
ever
get
off
the
ground
.

it
's
hard
to
tell
who
deserv
the
most
blame-the
incred
bland
and
corni
charact
or
the
horrif
lame
script
?

chabert
is
basic
the
onli
on
to
overdo
it
,
sound
like
a
whini
munchkin
on
helium
.

if
you
,
like
me
,
were
convinc
by
commerci
that
her
voic
wa
alter
for
some
sort
of
plot
twist
where
her
bodi
would
be
taken
over
by
alien
,
you
're
wrong
!

that
's
just
her
normal
voic
!

in
yet
anoth
exampl
of
a
``
friend
''
falter
on
the
big
screen
,
leblanc
is
so
incred
dull
and
yet
so
obvious
try
so
hard
to
be
so
incred
charm
-lrb-
make
sens
?
-rrb-

,
it
make
you
want
to
shove
hi
ass
out
the
escap
pod
corridor
without
an
escap
pod
.

graham
is
a
babe-thank
good
there
wa
someth
for
me
to
think
about
dure
thi
film
.

hurt
,
the
black
hole
of
excit
,
suck
up
ani
energi
that
might
have
been
left
.

if
hurt
were
avail
in
tablet
form
,
he
would
be
a
prescript
strength
sleep
pill
.

johnson
is
n't
dull
,
he
's
just
lame
as
the
young
know
it
all
who
wind
up
save
everybodi
's
ass
all
the
time
.

want
an
exampl
of
how
cool
thi
kid
can
be
?

how
about
when
he
convinc
the
robot
to
think
with
it
heart
and
reconsid
kill
the
famili
?

hei
,
do
n't
laugh-the
thing
actual
listen
to
the
mr.
roger-would-be-proud
sentiment
.

but
ala
,
if
you
thought
a
charact
could
n't
be
much
wors
,
there
wa
roger
as
the
epitom
of
gener
-lrb-
or
,
mother
as
she
wa
known
-rrb-
.

why
hire
an
actress
?

thei
could
've
had
a
white
cardboard
cutout
with
the
word
mom
print
on
it
.

now
that
would
've
had
some
pizzazz
