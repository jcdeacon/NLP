from
thi
point
,
the
movi
turn
into
a
seri
of
music
video
with
a
few
bit
of
act
in
between
.

those
hope
for
an
interest
and/or
funni
yarn
ar
given
too
mani
music
interlud
while
those
heavili
interest
in
the
music
ar
given
too
much
of
a
stori
.

onli
the
extrem
avid
blue
fan
should
attempt
get
thru
these
two
hour
.

for
those
peopl
,
it
mai
be
worth
it
,
for
luckili
there
is
much
more
music
than
shoddi
attempt
at
act
,
but
when
the
stori
doe
intrud
upon
the
festiv
,
the
film
is
heavili
bog
down
with
unfunni
joke
,
musician
turn
stiff
actor
,
and
the
pointless
10-year-old
buster
attempt
to
add
some
sort
of
home
alon
cute
to
the
whole
thing
.

appear
by
music
legend
such
as
aretha
franklin
,
jame
brown
,
eric
clapton
,
and
a
whole
slew
of
other
ar
the
high
point
of
the
film
,
but
thei
also
confirm
why
these
peopl
ar
musician
and
not
actor
.

blue
brother
2000
is
deserv
of
on
whole
star
simpli
becaus
if
you
realli
,
realli
love
thi
kind
of
music
,
you
might
kind
of
,
sort
of
like
thi
movi
.

mani
,
mani
scene
ar
nauseatingli
unfunni
,
and
if
you
do
n't
have
a
passion
for
veri
deep
blue/rock
,
you
'll
be
bore
out
of
your
skull
.

much
of
thi
film
seem
noth
more
than
aykroyd
's
self-serv
vaniti
project
,
but
no
matter
how
much
fun
aykroyd
mai
be
have
with
thi
,
none
of
the
excit
is
pass
on
to
the
audienc
.

and
see

can
onli
be
funni
for
so
long

unfortun
,
those
two

ar
over
about
fifteen
minut
into
the
film
.
