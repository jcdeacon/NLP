when

he
is
the
onli

stand
between

and

and
the
onli

.

long
's
act
talent
ar
abov
those
of
,
sai
,
steven
seagal
,
but
not
by
much
.

although
hi
deliveri
is
mostli
flat
and
wooden
,
he
's
a
likeabl
hero
,
and
there
ar
some
hint
here
and
there
that
he
mai
get
better
.

the
script
doe
n't
help
him
out
ani
,
howev
.

all
too
often
,
it
veer
into
the
realm
of
the
unintention
funni
.

the
dialogu
is
strictli
b-movi
materi
,
and
the
plot
reli
too
heavili
on
coincid
to
be
believ
.

long
's
co-star
ar
a
mix
bag
.

at
least
thei
're
all
comfort
in
their
respect
role
.

forsyth
ha
the
sceneri-chew
villain
down
cold
,
down
cold
,
and
scott
glenn
is
alwai
enjoy
to
watch
,
even
when
he
doe
n't
seem
to
be
stretch
hi
talent
-lrb-
as
is
definit
the
case
here
-rrb-
.

suzi
ami
plai
peril
pretti
well
,
but
is
n't
given
much
more
to
do
.

some
of
the
natur
and
wildfir
shot
ar
interest
,
but
mani
ar
rather
bland
.

you
'd
think
that
the
director
,
dean
semler
,
a
former
cinematograph
,
would
at
least
produc
a
film
with
interest
visual
.

that
's
not
the
case
.

there
's
a
lack
of
origin
to
nearli
all
the
sequenc
...
we
've
seen
thi
stuff
befor
.

it
's
not
the
most
auspici
start
to
1998
,
but
it
could
have
been
wors
-lrb-
just
think
back
to
1996
's
debut
,
bio-dome
-rrb-
.

howev
,
after
a
month
of
oscar-calib
pictur
,
a
movi
like
firestorm
at
least
give
you
some
perspect
on
how
good
those
movi
realli
were
.

in
fact
,
there
's
a
good
chanc
that
some
of
them
ar
still
plai
near
you
...
