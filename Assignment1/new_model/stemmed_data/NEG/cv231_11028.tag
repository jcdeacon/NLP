i

screenwrit
had
chosen
to
end
the
film
.

there
is
some
promis
,
but
it
's
all
in
the
setup
.

we
're
introduc
to
norman
goodman
-lrb-
dustin
hoffman
-rrb-
,
a
psychologist
who
onc
wrote
a
$
35,000
report
for
the
govern
about
what
to
do
in
the
event
that
a
crash
space
ship
is
discov
.

when
on
is
found
in
the
middl
of
nowher
,
1000
feet
below
the
surfac
of
the
pacif
ocean
,
norman
is
call
in
to
be
part
of
the
welcom
committe
.

on
the
team
with
him
ar
beth
halperin
-lrb-
sharon
stone
-rrb-
,
a
biochemist
who
wa
onc
hi
student
and
lover
;
harri
adam
-lrb-
samuel
l.
jackson
-rrb-
,
a
mathematician
who
earn
hi
first
doctor
at
the
ag
of
18
;
ted
field
-lrb-
liev
schreiber
-rrb-
,
an
astrophysicist
who
is
aw
by
the
opportun
to
explor
alien
technolog
;
and
harold
barn
-lrb-
peter
coyot
-rrb-
,
the
govern
oper
in
charg
of
the
mission
.

togeth
,
the
five
descend
into
the
bowel
of
the
ocean
,
where
thei
rendezv
with
a
temporari
sea
base
on
the
ocean
floor
from
which
thei
will
attempt
to
make
first
contact
.

for
a
while
,
sphere
had
me
fool
into
think
it
wa
go
to
take
an
astut
approach
to
the
man-meet-alien
situat
.

the
overal
scenario
is
not
without
promis
and
sever
plot
twist
-lrb-
such
as
the
revel
that
the
enorm
craft
is
actual
an
american
space
ship
,
appar
from
the
futur
-rrb-
offer
intrigu
possibl
.

then
,
right
around
the
on-hour
mark
-lrb-
that
's
the
time
to
sneak
into
the
theater
next
door
and
check
out
whatev
's
left
of
titan
-rrb-
,
the
virtual
non-stop
action
begin
,
and
,
onc
it
start
,
the
script
becom
superflu
.

thi
might
be
accept
if
director
levinson
gener
some
legitim
tension
,
but
,
instead
,
he
reli
on
loud
,
overbear
music
,
strang
camera
angl
,
and
quick
cut
to
make
thing
``
excit

''

addition
,
becaus
none
of
the
charact
ar
well-form
-lrb-
a
common
fail
in
anyth
pen
by
crichton
,
who
's
more
interest
in
technolog
than
peopl
-rrb-
,
viewer
do
n't
develop
much
of
a
root
interest
.

it
make
sit
through
sphere
a
frustrat
and
pointless
experi
.

what
about
that
a-list
cast
?

not
surprisingli
,
the
most
energet
perform
is
given
by
samuel
l.
jackson
,
but
hi
harri
is
n't
a
person
;
he
's
a
walk
plot
devic
spout
occasion-witti
dialogu
.

dustin
hoffman
is
n't
live
or
particularli
good
--
it
's
iron
that
thi
,
which
mai
be
hi
worst
work
in
a
decad
,
ha
arriv
in
theater
on
the
heel
of
hi
best
actor
nomin
-lrb-
for
wag
the
dog
-rrb-
.

sharon
stone
and
peter
coyot
ar
both
flat
.

their
charact
exhibit
littl
evid
of
emot
;
automaton
would
have
been
as
effect
.

then
there
's
queen
latifa
,
who
,
despit
get
fifth
bill
in
the
credit
-lrb-
ahead
of
liev
schreiber
,
who
boast
at
least
quadrupl
her
screen
time
-rrb-
,
ha
less
than
a
hand
of
line
and
almost
noth
to
do
other
than
inflat
the
bodi
count
.

i
like
to
think
that
levinson
and
hoffman
,
recogn
how
uninspir
thi
movi
wa
like
to
be
,
chose
to
make
wag
the

as
a
sort
of
penanc
-lrb-
the
low-budget
pictur
wa

dure

-rrb-
.

if
that
's
the
case
,
forgiv
is
grant
.

i
'm
less
inclin
to
look
favor
upon
crichton
,
although
he
ha
a
few
enjoy
titl
on
hi
resum
-lrb-
jurass
park
and
the
levinson-direct
disclosur
come
to
mind
-rrb-
.

even
if
hi
novel
wa
butcher
in
the
adapt
process
,
crichton
's
credit
as
a
produc
disallow
him
absolut
.

he
wa
a
will
particip
in
a

no
wonder
sphere
is
be
releas
in
februari
,
in
the
midst
of
the

.

it
deserv
no
better
than
to
get
sunk

which
