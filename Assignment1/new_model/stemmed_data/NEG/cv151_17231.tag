of

newman
.

sarandon
.

hackman
.

with
an
a-list
cast
of
oscar
laureat
like
that
,
``
twilight
''
would
seem
veri
promis
.

howev
,
the
script
is
tire
and
predict
.

it
would
serv
well
as
a
tv-movi-of-the-week
,
possibl
with
some
1970
's
detect
hero
repris
hi
role
.

the
appeal
of
the
project
for
it
star
and
it
director
,
robert
benton
,
is
nostalgia
.

``
twilight
''
want
veri
much
to
be
a
1940
's
film
noir
with
alan
ladd
or
dick
powel
.

all
of
the
standard
trope
ar
here
:
a
hard-boil
p.i.
among
the
rich
and
beauti
whose
glamour
hide
sinist
secret
,
a
femm
fatal
who
tempt
and
confound
the
hero
,
shadowi
figur
shoot
from
doorwai
,
dead
bodi
confront
the
hero
at
everi
turn
,
cop
dog
hi
path
and
interf
with
hi
investig
.

the
script
offer
littl
origin
,
and
co-author
benton
and
richard
russo
seem
unawar
that
what
wa
origin
in
1948
is
a
clich
in
1998
.

elmer
bernstein
's
score
is
hauntingli
melod
and
could
have
been
drawn
note-for-note
from
a
vintag
noir
.

the
lead
actor
try
hard-none
of
the
three
ha
everi
made
less
than
a
full
effort
,
even
when
burden
with
a
bad
script
.

thei
try
to
invest
everi
line
and
gestur
with
mean
,
and
thei
creat
a
convinc
sens
of
the
relationship
between
the
main
charact
.

harri
is
fond
of
jack
but
is
in
love
with
catherin
.

jack
is
dy
of
cancer
and
is
jealou
of
harri
's
love
for
catherin
.

catherin
teas
harri
and
enjoi
hi
attent
,
but
her
real
feel
ar
hidden
beneath
a
carefulli-maintain
veneer
.

``
twilight
''
want
to
be
charact-driven
like
``
nobodi
's
fool
''
-lrb-
also
direct
by
benton
,
also
star
newman
,
base
on
a
novel
by
russo
-rrb-
wa
,
but
the
tire
script
give
the
actor
too
littl
to
work
with
.

``
twilight
''
also
squander
a
fine
support
cast
:
