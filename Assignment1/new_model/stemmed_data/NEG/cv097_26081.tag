''
and
a
host
of
other
popular

that
turn
a

off

as
toler
vicar
and
policemen
,
plenti
of
eccentr
,
and
of
local
who
stick
togeth
through
thick
and
thin
.

the
strength
of
thi
film
li
in
it
ration
theme
,
that
smoke
pot
should
be
legal
sinc
it
is
even
less
danger
than
drink
alcohol
.

the
film
is
toler
until
after
it
first
hour
,
it
then
fall
complet
apart
,
becom
just
too
absurd
to
consid
as
anyth

gone
complet

but
it
long
overdu
messag
of
decrimin

is
on

and
allow
the
film
to
,
at
least
,
be
view
as
contain
a
pertin

it
messag
is
especi
appropri
nowadai
consid
the
`
war
on
drug
'
is
about
to
be
escal
into
colombia
.

the
drug

ha
been
a
total
failur
so
far
and
with
no
hope
of
it
be
won
by
law
enforc

in

it
ha
so
far
just
end

with
the
idea
that

stop

in

everyth
about
thi
propos
action
smack
of
vietnam
,
with
thi
scenario
closer
to
home
,
so
what
probabl
await
such
an

is
a
more
futil

than
the

the

find

someth

is
a
theme
long
overdu
for
public
accept
,
but
on
that
is
better
receiv
late
than
never
.

there
ha
to
be
some
common
sens
in
distinguish
what
drug
should
be
legal
and
how
to
educ
the
public
on
thi
,
rather
than
make
it
a
polic

altogeth
.

the
film
open
in
a
quaint
cornish

villag
at
the
funer

for

thi
is
a

;
for

the

the

pretend
not
to
notic
what
the
bright
light
in
grace
's
greenhous
is
for
,
the
friendli

counsel
about
the
wisdom
of
not
take
action
over
someth

,
and
the
doctor

enjoi
smoke

the
stori
becom
incredul
when
grace
decid
to
go
to
london
and
score
with
a
big-time
drug
dealer
instead
of
have
matthew
go
,
becaus
she
find
out
nicki
is
pregnant
and
doe
n't
want
matthew
to
end
up
in
jail
.

it
is
interest
to
note
,
that
no
on
think
smoke
grass
is
bad
for
you
,
onli
that
on
can
go
to
jail
.

the
scene
with
grace
on
portobello
road
in
the
not
hill
section
of
london
,
try
to
find
a
drug
dealer
,
while
dress
out
of
place
,
in
a
white
dress
and
hat
on
would
wear
to
a
tea
parti
in
cornwal
but
not
on
the
street
of
not
hill
while
look
to
make
a
drug
deal
,
wa
complet
hokei
and
the
film
descend
into
a
huge
black
hole
,
wherebi
it
never
recov
it
digniti
.

the
film
move
into
the
formula
mode
,
wherea
grace
beat
the
odd
against
her
fail
to
surviv
,
as
she
meet
an
intern
drug
dealer
,
a
frenchman
-lrb-
tcheki
karyo
-rrb-
,
who
is
first
seen
threaten
to
cut
off
her

but
later
becom
her

and
husband
as
she
becom
a

therebi
becom

thing
work
out
in
a
ridicul
wai
,
where
there
is
a
total
breakdown
in
the
charact
develop
of
grace
,
where
thi
matronli
figur
suddenli
becom
mere
a
cartoon
figur
instead
of
live
flesh
and
blood
.

there
ar
a
lot
of
silli
giggl
that
come
forth
and
the
film
ha
just
enough
of
an
act
perform
by

blethyn
to
breath
air
into

befor
it
come
to
it
belat
final

,
until
it
make
the

that
the

.

thi
`
unhip

film
leav
on
with
the
impress
that
smoke

is
silli
,
but
should
be
