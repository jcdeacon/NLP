fishburn
bump
head
for

but
the
plot
's
a
joke

there

,
albert
finnei
disappear
so
deepli
into
the
role
of
a
lovabl
dublin
bu
conductor
that
it
's
a
shame
when
the
film
get
so
seriou
around
him
.

hi
charact
is
a
conductor
with
a
passion
for

he
read

for
about
an

there
's
a
sweet
magic
behind
finnei
and
hi
troup
of
work-class
stiff

conflict
aris
,
but
it
's
small
stuff
--
an
administr
from
the
bu
compani
here
,
an

cathol
pork
butcher
-lrb-
michael
gambon
-rrb-
there

but
with
finnei
at
the
wheel
,
so
to
speak
,
the
film
roll
smoothli
over
these
plot
point
--
just
like
the
gorgeou
leland
doubl-decker
bu
in
the
stori
.

where
thing
get
seriou
is
toward
the
end
of
the
film
,
when
the
plot
take
a
turn
that
the
bu
never
would
,
and
the
stori
head
down
a
veri
dark
allei
that
mark
the
end
of
an
enjoy
ride
.

the
twist
make
sens
--
and
help
paint
a
complet
pictur
of
finnei
's
charact
--
but
the
trip
to
get
there
betrai
the
light
,
airi
atmospher
of
what
had
come
befor
.

it
's
not
a
fatal
misstep
,
mind
you
,
and
it
doe
n't
send
the

it
's
just
a
