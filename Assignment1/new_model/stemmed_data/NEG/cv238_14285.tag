thi

in
their
search
for

.

jazz
ha
an
idea
for
a
local
talk
show
;
it
would
featur
women
talk
about
sex
and
date
.

she
and
her
friend
make
a
demo
tape
of
interview
with
the
women
of
miami
.

the
film
itself
is
sprinkl
with
these
real
interview
throughout
,
both
as
part
of
the
plot
and
as
commentari
on
the
situat
of
the
main
charact
.

the
fact
that
thei
ar
real
provid
a
refresh
break
from
some
of
the
more
melodramat
moment
in
the
film
.

there
ar
sever
moment
of
bad
act
,
corni
dialogu
,
and
emot
overextens
.

in
a
low-budget
independ
film
from
a
first-time
director
,
these
fault
can
sometim
be
forgiven
,
if
the
screenplai
is
fresh
and
solid
.

that
is
not
the
case
here
.

the
script
suffer
from
random
plot
develop
.

there
ar
four
or
five
of
these
turn
in
the
plot
,
each
on
rais
the
question
``
where
did
that
come
from
?
''

at
on
point
,
a
charact
ha
a
lifelong
reconcili
with
her
mother
.

we
ar
suppos
to
be
move
,
but
sinc
the
scene
is
complet
un-led-up
to
,
we
realli
do
n't
care
if
she
and
her
mother
get
along
.

we
've
never
seen
her
mother
befor
.

we
never
see
her
again
.

who
care
?

what
's
wors
,
these
sudden
develop
ar
suppos
to
engag
our
sympathi
.

at
anoth
point
,
a
charact
announc
that
she
ca
n't
have
children
.

appar
,
thi
is
devast
.

we
would
n't
know
thi
becaus
she
never
talk
about
have
kid
befor
,
but
we
ar
nevertheless
expect
to
be
devast
for
her
.

the
scene
feel
like
an
afterthought
,
it
emot
manipul
and
shallow
.

these
scene
grow
wors
and
wors
,
culmin
in
an
absurd
climax
.

two
scene
were
plai
with
such
overwhelm
melodrama
that
i
found
myself
laugh
.

on
scene
is
a
lover
's
spat
between
two
minor
charact
.

the
other
ha
the
main
charact
express
their
copiou
grief
by
clean
hous
in
wail
of
despair
and
cloud
of
ajax
.

think
on
these
scene
,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
admit
that
the
film
ha
redeem
qualiti
.

but
it
doe
.

first
,
it
is
origin
.

we
men
often
wonder
what
women
talk
about
when
thei
ar
alon
in
group
,
and
i
imagin
thi
film
give
me
a
pretti
good
idea
.

it
's
someth
i
do
n't
think
ha
been
the
subject
of
a
film
.

second
,
the
interview
of
the
miami
women
ar
sincer
.

taken
togeth
,
thei
form
a
mosaic
pictur
of
miami
beachwalk
and
bistro
diner
.

the
mosaic
is
made
of
sound
bite
and
stereotyp
,
but
each
tile
is
some
woman
's
real
experi
.

neither
the
pictur
of
women
,
nor
their
pictur
of
men
,
is
truli
repres
,
but
the
point
is
that
both
set
of
gener
ar
tell
in
their
own
wai
.

at
some
level
,
the
stereotyp
that
emerg
can
be
call
true
.

i
can
imagin
some
peopl
like
thi
film
when
it
charact
talk
about
their
``
like
,
dislik
,
skill
,
and
thrill
,
''
but
on
the
whole
,
it
's
pretti
bad
.

and
that
make
it
even
harder
to
forgiv
the
bad
act
,
corni
dialogu
,
and
emot
overextens
.

i
'll
give
beyer
on
more
strike
,
and
then
she
's
out
