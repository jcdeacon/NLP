speci

fail
to
capit
on
a
potenti

and
instead
run
the
gamut
from
ridicul
silli
to
unmitigatedli
stupid
.

the
film
follow
the
exploit
of
a
young
man
,
patrick
ross

justin
lazard
-rrb-
,
whose
sole
focu
is
on
cruis
along
the
street
in

,
loiter
in
strip
club
,
and
gener
try
to

as

in
other
word
,
patrick
is
like
a

of

these
activ
could
describ
the
everydai
routin
of
a
huge
percentag
of
men
hi

but
there
's
a
catch
--
he
's
an
astronaut
who
recent
return
from
a
seemingli
success
mission
to
mar
,
and
who
's
now
infect
with
alien

patrick

patrick

thi

the
evil
alien

which
ultim
infest

watch
as
it
slink

the

of
the
spaceship
,
ani
question
as
to
whether
or
not
thi
is
a
cheesi
b-movi
is
quickli
answer
.

mr.
brancato
's
origin
screenplai
is
fill
with
outrag
line
which
often
leav
the
audienc
in
stitch
.

like
the
first
film
-lrb-
and
perhap
in
homag
to
it
-rrb-
,
there
's
a
real
penchant
for
dialogu
which
underlin
the
obviou
.

last
time
around
featur
the
hootworthi
line
utter
by
forest
whitak
's
psychic
empath
charact
upon
enter
a
bloodsoak
room
--
``
someth
bad
happen
here

''

thi
time
,
laura
get
to
stand
over
a
fresh
,
shred
corps
with
it
entail
rip
out
and
mutter
``
thi
is
aw
.
''

and
she
's
not
even
empath
!

and
when
a
psychot
horni
patrick
accost
a
supermarket
shopper
and
drag
her
kick
and
scream
behind
the
build
in
a
woefulli-pace

whatev
-rrb-
,
helpfulli
tell
our
alien-hunt
protagonist
,
``
he

''

while
speci
ii
is
often
unintention
hilari
,
at
least
it
occasion
demonstr
a
sens
of
humour
of
it
own
.

there
's
an
amus
,
tongu-in-cheek
bit
of
product
placement
-lrb-
which
doe
n't
realli
make
much
sens
,
but
i
appreci
the
sentiment
-rrb-
,
as
well
as
some
supermarket-relat
hijinx
-lrb-
``
he
's
in
aisl

!
''

inform
ev
-rrb-
.

if
the
film
maintain
thi
sort
of
light-heart
tone
,
it
would
have
been
much
more
charm
and
enjoy
to
watch
,
but
,
to
it
detriment
,
it
instead
take
it
silli
plot
far
too
serious
and
barrel
along
to
a
bloodi
,
effect-laden
anticlimact
conclus
.

much
of
the
film
fail
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
sens
,
and
there
ar
such
gape
plot
hole
that
it
's
terribl
difficult
to
contain
ani
suspens
of
disbelief
.

the
implaus
ar
endless
:
what
about
the
toxic
bomb
in
ev
's
brain
?

why
ar
the
guard
arm
with
gun
when
thei
alreadi
know
firearm
ar
ineffectu
?

my
favourit
wa
the
slow-motion
sequenc
in
the
film
where
ev
,
sport
superhuman
strength
,
is
shown
toss
asid
guard
who
ar
attempt
to
contain
her
with
what
look
like
bodi
block
.

thi
is
the
sort
of
movi
which
leav
you
hold
your
head
in
amaz
disbelief
,
incredul
that
it
's
be
foist
upon
the
public
.

much
