``

come
at
the
end
of
as
summer
where
we
've
alreadi
experienc
man

``

-rrb-
,

and
even
a

``

''
-rrb-
.

now
,
``
the
13th
warrior
''
present
a
tribe
of
flesh
eat
men
who
believ
that
thei
ar
bear
.

the
stori
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
to
call
it
,
follow
ahm
ibn
fahdlan
-lrb-
antonio
bandera
-rrb-
an
arabian
poet
who
fall
in
love
with
hi
king
's
wife
and
is
banish
from
hi
home
land
.

he
then
travel
to
the
land
of
the
vike
and
becom
an
ambassador
to
them
.

eventu
the
vike
ar
call
upon
to
protect
the
peopl
of
the
villag
who
ar
be
hunt
by
the
flesh
eat
men
.

thirteen
warrior
ar
chosen
to
go
on
the
mission
,
and
as
you
guess
it
,
ahm
is
chosen
as
the
thirteenth
.

he
's
not
a
warrior
,
and
at
first
not
well
accept
by
the
vike
,
but
as
the
movi
advanc
he
'll
have
to
prove
himself
both
on
and
off
the
battlefield
.

that
's
basic
the
entir
plot
.

there
is
also
a
romant
subplot
that
ha
been
so
badli
mishandl
and
,
on
assum
,
drastic
cut
that
you
begin
to
wonder
why
the
filmmak
did
n't
just
edit
out
all
of
the
scene
attain
to
that
part
of
the
stori
.

instead
thei
chose
to
leav
just
enough
of
those
scene
in
to
annoi
the
viewer
.

the
film
is
basic
non-stop
action
and
when
it
paus
and
tri
to
develop
a
stori
it
becom
a
laugh
stock
.

the
battl
scene
,
although
well
choreograph
,
ar
not
involv
and
not
the
least
bit
excit
.

we
do
n't
get
to
know
ani
of
the
charact
and
so
we
do
n't
care
who
live
and
who
di
.

the
film
,
which
want
to
be
beowolf
,
come
across
more
as
a
fail
action-adventur
stori
aspir
to
epic
proport
but
not
achiev
it
on
ani
level
.

it
wa
direct
by
john
mctiernan
who
's
,
``
the
thoma
crown
affair
''
is
also
plai
in
theater
current
.

and
it
's
not
that
mctiernan
work
simultan
on
both
film
but
that
,
``
the
13th
warrior
''
wa
place
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
with
the
studio
just
wait
for
a
time
to
dump
it
on
audienc
.

it
belong
back
on
the
shelf
.
