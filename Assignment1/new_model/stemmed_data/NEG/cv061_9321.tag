okai
,
here
's
the
deal
.

i
'll
be
the
first
on
to
grant
that
everybodi
need
a
dai
off
now
and
then
.

i
'll
even
go
so
far
as
to
sai
that
a
vacat
is
a
necessari
part
of
do
ani
job
well
.

i
mean
,
hei
,
i
've
been
known
to
stretch
a
weekend
into
a
three-dai
out
,
if
fridai
look
to
be
a
slow
dai
.

and
if
mondai
ai
n't
look
like
a
pick-me-up
,
well
,
i
've
been
known
to
give
martha
nell
a
call
and
sai
,
``
do
me
a
favor
,
sweetheart
.
''

bump
old
man
ferguson
's
boil
lanc
to
tuesdai
morn
,
and
tell
miss
audrei
that
i
'll
swing
by
her
hous
mondai
even
and
see
if
we
ca
n't
get
her
trick
knee
back
in
line
.
''
''

a
simpl
sentenc
like
that
,
and
i
've
got
a
nice
four-dai
fish
trip
with
the
boi
,
or
more
often
than
not
,
a
trip
up
to
cheroke
,
n.c.
,
for
jackpot
bingo
and
assort
other
mountain
funneri
.

but
the
point
is
,
if
you
take
a
dai
off
,
do
someth
differ
.

if
you
've
work
yourself
silli
for
month
,
relax
a
bit
.

sleep
in
.

eat
pancak
at
noon
.

microwav
an
egg
in
it
shell
.

watch
pro
wrestl
with
the
sound
off
.

listen
to
some
barri
white
record
at
high
speed
.

whatev
.

but
do
not
,
under
ani
circumst
,
spend
your
vacat
do
the
same
thing
you
do
for
a
live
.

and
,
if
you
do
,
do
n't
make
the
final
product
look
ten
time
wors
than
it
would
ani
other
time
.

becaus
i
do
not
want
to
hear
your
sob
stori
,
oliv
stone
.

you
appar
thought
you
need
a
break
from
make
``
import
film
.
''

cool
.

so
you
found
thi
hinki
littl
book
and
decid
to
make
it
a
movi
.

that
's
cool
,
too
.

but
,
olli
,
old
sage
,
do
not
take
a
good
stori
and
a
hot
cast
and
make
on
of
the
most
pointless
and
worthless
film
of
the
decad
.

i
'm
just
eager
to
meet
you
on

,
so
i
can
bui

stretch

and
we
have
a
five-finger
discount
from
doc
hollywood
,
where
the
whole
stori
occur
becaus
of
car
troubl
,
forc
the
main
charact
to
stai
at
the
merci
of
the
town
and
the
mechan
.

okai
,
he
's
work
from
a
book
,
so
mayb
olli
's
not
total
to
blame
for
blatantli
cop
these
idea
.

i
just
expect
a
man
who
can
make
up
an
altern
histori
of
the
unit
state
to
be
abl
to
craft
a
few
origin
idea
befor
expos
the
neg
.

i
just
wish
he
had
n't
brought
a
cast
like
thi
togeth
for
what
amount
to
a
group
toe-stub
.

sean
penn
give
a
great
perform
,
and
jennif
lopez
and
nick
nolt
ar
as
on
target
as
thei
can
be
,
plai
over-the-top
caricatur
of
stereotyp
charact
.

the
best
thing
about
the
movi
is
watch
penn
react
to
the
mad
around
him
and
try
to
figur
out
exactli
what
the
blanketi-blank
is
go
on
.

too
bad
it
's
not
fun
to
watch
when
it
's
happen
to
us
...
while
we
sit
through
thi
mess
of
a
film
.

u-turn
is
not
a
bad
film
if
you
're
a
fan
of
techniqu
.

it
's
the
oliv
stone
you
've
alwai
known
.

robert
richardson
is
hi
usual
cinematograph
,
and
rob
and
olli
know
how
to
shoot
a
flick
--
great
camera
angl
,
shift
viewpoint
,
wick
color
,
nice
look
pictur
.

but
pictur
of
what
?

i
think
i
'd
rather
stare
at
a
xerox
envelop
for
two
hour
than
try
to
figur
out
the
tilt-o-whirl
point
of
thi
loser
film
.

plot
twist
ar
on
thing
,
repetit
is
almost
unforgiv
,
and
thi
is
dang
near
as
unforgiv
as
ani
movi
i
've
seen
in
the
past
five
year
.

oliv
,
i
know
your
bodi
of
work
is
noth
to
sniff
at
.

you
've
been
nice
enough
to
limit
us
to
onli
on
door
movi
,
and
film
like
platoon
,
jfk
,
wall
street
and
nixon
give
us
plenti
to
dig
on
.

your
script
ar
certainli
respect
,
your
budget
ar
up
there
on
the
screen
,
and
your
actor
do
n't
dog
it
.

and
i
know
that
,
mayb
,
with
u-turn
,
you
were
just
kick
back
,
just
have
fun
.

that
's
fine
.

but
do
n't
do
that
with
a
movi
with
the
potenti
of
thi
on
.

do
some
polic
academi
sequel
-lrb-
imagin
that
.
-rrb-

do
a
big
comedi
,
like
a
remak
of
it
's
a
mad
,
mad
,
mad
,
mad
world
.

but
do
not
drop
a
limp
u-turn
out
of
your
pocket
and
expect
us
to
accept
it
as
``
an
oliv
stone
movi
,
''
and
not
question
why
it
stink
like
week-old
snook
.

there
's
a
right
wai
to
have
fun
,
and
a
wrong
wai
to
have
fun
.

thi
wa
as
wrong
as
you
can
get
without
go
to
jail
.
