``
eas
on
of
the
worst
film
of
the
year
.
.
''

with
the
millenium
just
around
the
corner
,
hollywood
is
plai
with
our
insecur
concern
the
biggest
event
of
thi
centuri
.

thi
time
it
is
arnold
schwartzenegg
against
the
power
of
evil
.

the
result
is
somewhat
predict
.

i
did
n't
have
high
hope
about
arnold
's
``
much
anticip
''
return
to
the
big
screen
.

schwarzenegg
fan
will
probabl
be
pleas
,
action
lover
wo
n't
be
bore
,
and
the
cathol
leagu
will
be
angri
.

everyon
els
will
see
'
end
of
dai
'
for
what
it
is
:
a
delici
bad
motion
pictur
.

think
of
it
as
hollywood
's
own
y2k
bug
.

did
you
know
that
if
you
turn
the
three
diabol
number
666
you
'll
get
999
,
as
in
1999
?

ye
,
you
better
believ
it
.
.

satan
is
here
on
earth
,
work
on
hi
latest
project
--
the
end
of
dai
.

thi
time
it
is
gabriel
burn
who
get
the
privileg
to
plai
lucif
and
,
although
not
al
pacino
,
he
is
fun
to
behold
.

he
coolli
stroll
through
manhattan
in
the
borrow
bodi
of
an
invest
banker
,
wreak
,
as
thei
sai
,
havoc
.

the
wai
it
work
is
he
smirk
and
someth
explod
.

befor
the
stroke
of
the
new
millennium
he
's
got
to
find
and
impregn
a
certain
woman
in
order
to
climb
out
from
under
a
heavenli
curs
as
spell
out
in
the
book
of
revel
.

onli
schwarzenegg
's
cop
attach
to
an
anti-terrorist
unit
can
stop
him
.

film
like
thi
ha
on
seriou
weak
--
logic
.

no
matter
how
you
twist
the
``
plot
''
,
you
'll
find
it
incred
stupid
-lrb-
even
for
a
schwartzenegg
movi
!
-rrb-
.

the
incred
fact
is
that
such
director
never
learn
.

after
thousand
of
headless
product
,
thi
theme
ha
becom
on
big
clich
.

here
the
devil
look
more
like
a
sex
addict
maniac
that
ha
just
got
out
of
a
mental
institut
.

he
is
walk
around
n.y.
,
blow
everyth
up
and
kill
everyon
that
get
in
a
5
meter
radiu
.

all
he
want
is
the
girl
,
that
is
somehow
special
.

but
schwartzenegg
is
more
clever
than
he
look
,
he
ha
hidden
her
in
a
church
,
where
satan
dare
not
enter
.

so
the
evil
on
is
forc
to
seduc
the
good
cop
in
order
to
get
the
valuabl
inform
:
``
you
can
have
your
wife
and
daughter
back
.
.

i
can
give
you
happi
that
you
can
onli
dream
of
.
.

just
give
me
the
address
.
.
''

inde
with
a
script
like
that
,
you
could
make
a
wonder
parodi
,
but
unfortun
the
director
is
take
thi
subject
veri
serious
,
attempt
to
creat
a
provok
an
dramat
thriller
.

and
for
you
who
have
await
arnold
swartzenegg
's
comeback
,
will
not
be
veri
satisfi
.

we
've
not
seen
him
in
a
while
.

that
's
becaus
he
did
n't
have
a
worthi
oppon
.

he
ha
battl
nuclear
terrorist
on
earth
and
power
mad
conspir
on
mar
.

he
ha
taken
on
alien
predat
in
the
darkest
reach
of
the
jungl
and
morph
cyberkil
that
seemingli
noth
can
stop
.

so
,
after
all
those
fight
,
what
's
left
for
arnold
schwarzenegg
?

how
about
satan
?

in
my
opinion
,
he
ha
never
quit
overcom
hi
first
role
as
the
deadli
robot
in
cameron
's
``
termin
''
.

and
that
is
schwartzenegg
's
strength
--
muscl
and
no
emot
.

here
he
tri
to
achiev
an
artist
level
,
move
toward
the
oscar
.

thi
is
call
``
an
adult
turn
''
if
success
and
``
a
flop
''
if
unsuccess
.

make
a
wild
guess
!

hi
charact
ha
lost
hi
wife
and
daughter
and
ha
seriou
drink
problem
.

thi
requir
at
least
some
act
skill
.

regrett
,
the
onli
thing
convinc
about
old
arnold
is
hi
muscl
.

the
rest
of
the
cast
ar
struggl
with
their
so
call
charact
.

the
movi
is
otherwis
technic
impress
,
with
a
solid
cinematographi
and
fine
light
.

but
the
movi
doe
n't
serv
neither
as
a
seriou
thriller
-lrb-
becaus
of
it
stupid
-rrb-
nor
as
comic
entertain
-lrb-
becaus
of
it
seriou
tone
-rrb-
.

the
onli
real
comic
relief
in
thi
film
is
when
swartzenegg
tri
to
cry
.

the
action
sequenc
ar
all
recycl
and
the
effect
ar
everyth
but
spectacular
.

so
i
realli
have
a
hard
time
recommend
thi
film
to
somebodi
.

unless
you
ar
a
die-hard
schwartzenegg
fan
,
stai
awai
.

as
for
schwarzenegg
,
he
'll
be
back
.
