,
who
have
come
to
steal
heyst
's
rumour
plunder
.

while
the
novel
is
larg
complex
in
character
,
the
film
sadli
transpos
conrad
's
charact
into
lacklustr
lead
,
the
most
disappoint
be
heyst
himself
.

conrad
's
heyst
adher
religi
to
hi
late
father
's
wai
of
detach
and
isol
.

hi
ascet
lifestyl
is
thrown
into
question
when
he
meet
alma
,
a
helpless
orchestra
girl
who
charm
him
with
her
voic
.

the
struggl
to
embrac
the
arriv
of
alma
into
hi
solitud
,
howev
,
is
lost
in
mark
peplo
's
-lrb-
director
and
writer
-rrb-
dilut
version
of
heyst
.

without
properli
establish
the
crucial
detail
of
heyst
's
charact
,
all
that
is
left
of
conrad
's
main
charact
is
a
veri
shallow
treatment
of
hi
intern
conflict
between
detach
and
human
involv
.

on
the
on
hand
,
actual
the
subtext
is
a
mammoth
task
-lrb-
though
not
imposs
-rrb-
,
but
on
the
other
hand
,
dafo
's
flat
act
can
not
be
excus
as
an
attempt
at
stoicism
.

in
the
end
,
we
ar
suppos
to
wit
heyst
renounc
hi
philosophi
and
final
come
to
an
understand
of
what
it
is
to
love
anoth
.

the
final
transform
,
while
percept
,
lack
the
cathart
revel
which
is
undeni
in
conrad
's
novel
.

it
absenc
in
the
film
is
unforgiv
.

the
film
seem
more
concern
about
move
the
plot
along
when
so
much
ha
yet
to
be
said
about
the
relationship
between
the
two
complet
stranger

alma
is
suppos

emot
barrier
in
the
relationship
,
name
heyst
's

of

which
heyst
himself
grappl
with
.

the
struggl
against
heyst
's
ignor
of
true
human
involv
account
for
much
of
the
great
of
alma
's
love
for
him
.

jacob

fair-skin
,
gentl
and
yet
passion
,
handl
the
role
with

is

a
blatant

approach
.

all
we
know
of
the
charact
ar
mostli
explain
by
their
line
alon
.

thi
is
unsatisfactori
when
so
much
of
the
turmoil
experienc
by
the
two
stem
from
their
buri
thought
and

the
sketchi

also
fall
short
of
