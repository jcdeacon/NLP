in

for

when
hi

``
dirti

,
is
noth
more
than
a
sophomor
comedi
about
two
best

who
grow
up

emotion
,
thei
've
never
outgrown
their
pubesc
year
,
which
is
somewhat
amusingli
explor
in
a
begin
flashback

although
have
no
appar
real
world
skill
,
the
on
thing
that
these
two
have
alwai
been
adept
at
is
get
back
at
peopl
.

if
the
meter
maid
wa
unjust
in
give
you
a
ticket
,
then
dump
a
bunch
of
unpop

of
corn
onto
the

watch

burst
apart

need
to
come
up
with

50,000
in
a
period
of
two
week
so
that
sam
's
dad
-lrb-
jack
warden
-rrb-
can
have
a
heart
oper

their
idea
is
to
start
a
reveng-for-hire
busi
where
thei
'll
do
your
dirti
work
.

in
the
funniest
scene
-lrb-

possibl
the
onli
funni
scene
-rrb-
of
the
movi
,
thei
take
advantag
of
a
live
televis
shoot
at
a
nearbi

their
presenc
is

when

them
and
then
reneg
on

payment
,
the
two
go
to
work
to
exact
their
sordid
brand
of
reveng

by

possibl
anoth

-rrb-
,
the
dirti
work
is
uninspir

becom
about
as
funni
