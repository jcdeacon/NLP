brought
on
by
the
inexor

and
,
onc
again
,
we
have
on
of
the
worst
film
of
the
year
.

the
trend
of
the
moment
--
and
bear
in
mind
it
's
a
trend
not
a
movi-is
spawn
,
and
if
you
've
seen
the
anim
seri
on
hbo
you
'll
recal
it
embodi
the
lost
life
of
a
disfigur
man
,
an
individu
who
ha
transpir
the
ultim
punish
:
he
's
been
sent
to
hell
.

todd
mcfarlan
,
the
creator
of
the
spawn
comic
book
,
must
have
had
a
tough
time
sit
through
spawn
,
for
hi
creativ
and
theme
about
resurrect
and
loss
of
ident
were
all
be
jettison
in
favor
of
reliabl
special
effect
,
style
over
substanc
,
ambienc
over
anyth
els
.

not
onli
doe
spawn
reli
entir
on
special

,
the
stori
,
about
a
bewild
individu
who
must
take
on
a
group
of
bad
gui
and
find
himself
in
the
process
is
realiz
in
such
a
sordid
,
incap
manner
,
it
becom
indigest
after
a
while
.

everi
charact
in
thi
film
is
lifeless
,
vacuou
and
seemingli
written
by
a
depress
colleg
student
.

the
stori
begin
,
like
in
everi
superhero
movi
in
thi
ag
,
with
a
man
live
an
idyl
life
.

al
simmon
-lrb-
michael

,
a

and
is
content
with
the
job
hi
boss
,
jason
wynn
-lrb-
martin
sheen
-rrb-
,
provid
him
.

the
next
element
in
the
film
is
the
part
when
thing
go
awri
.

and
as
expect
,
everyon
turn
the
tabl
on
poor
al.
.

as
the
two
ar
investig
their
latest
mission
at
some
sort
of
biolog
weapon
plant
,
al
is
befriend
by
jason
,
and
di
in
a
gori
and
truli
sicken
scene
.

inevit
,
it
lead
everyon
to
the
conclus
that
he
ha
pass
awai
.

henc
,
jason
's
mischiev
master-mind
plan
,
to
`
conquer
the
world
``
is
just
commenc
it

,
when

a
pact
with
satan

,
agre
to
command
the
devil
's
armi
to
take
over
the
world
and
he
get
to
see
hi
famili

.
''

so
,
our
pal
al
ha
been
uplift
to
hell
,
and
while
hi
transform
from
normal
gui
to
spawn
take
place
,
hi
ol'
partner
terri
form
a
relationship
with
hi
wife
.

time
pass
.

and
now
spawn
is
present
in
the
grotesqu
inner
citi
,
the
ghetto
where
cog
-lrb-
nicol
williamson
-rrb-
teach
spawn
how
to
util
hi
neat
artifact
,
hi
motorbik
,
armor
,
etc.
.
.

thi
charact
is
mere
a
poor
man
's
obi
wan
kenobi
without
all
the
mytholog
hoopla
.

now
the
stage
is
set
spawn
,
the
new
`
enemi
of
evil
'
vs
evil
.

and
evil
take
the
cake
,
doubtlessli
.

john
leguizamo
's
delici
heinou
perform
as
the
injuri
clown
work
for
wynn
is
the
film
's
relief
point
.

all
thi
anguish
,
pain
,
half-bake
theme
and
putrid
action
scene
ar
invis
to
leguizamo
,
who
steal
the
show
and
deriv
joi
from
hi
charact
,
which
is
basic
a
compil
of
so-so
on
liner
.

and
then
there
's
martin
sheen
.

whichev
wai
you
look
you
will
find
carv
board
near
hi
piti
and
downright
appal
last
two
year
.

hi
select
call
for
an
immedi
fire
of
hi
agent
.

as
the
megalomaniac
boss
,
hi
caricatur
plai
like
a
bad
dream
out
of
a
b-movi
,
scrambl
,
and
left
in
the
shelf
to
rot
.

thi
is
the
man
that
star
in
film
such
as
apocalyps
now
and
wall
street
.

i
'd
never
thought
i
'd
be
sai
thi
,
but
at
thi
junctur
,
charli
sheen
's
career
is
in
better
shape
.

spawn
is
a
movi
in
which
realism
,
or
even
an
attempt
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
problem
of
the
hero
and
real
life
is
identifi
.

for
most
of
the
film
the
vapid
michael
jai
white
consum
hi
time
ogl
,
jump
through
roof
,
and
perform
all
kind
of
acrobat
exercis
which
even
batman
and
robin
accomplish
better
.

it
constantli
remind
us
we
were
watch
a
superhero
movi
--
a
veri
bad
superhero
movi
.

continu
the
film
kept
on
depend
on
special
effect
,
and
sadli
,
thi
is
how
pictur
ar
be
made
.

perhap
no
other
movi
better
than
spawn
illustr
the
deterior
of
cinema
through
comput
wizardri
.

the
filmmak
seem
to
have
forgotten
everi
human
element
possibl
.

the
qualiti
of
thi
film
is
abysm
and
insult
.

it
is
percept
that
director
mark
dipp
,
attempt
to
touch
the
psycholog
chord
that
tim
burton
's
batman
did
touch
,
the
desper
of
a
man
whose
life
ha
all
but
evapor
in
on
spontan
act
.

but
bruce
wayn
had
human
element
to
him
.

he
wa
pensiv
,
resourc
and
had
relationship
,
which
made
our
perspect
on
him
equal
human
.

the
charact
of
al
simmon
seem
to
be
long
for
a
drastic
chang
,
as
if
he
's
fatigu
about
be
normal
.

and
as
all
superhero
,
batman
,
superman
,
the
phantom
,
thei
must
possess
an
element
of
normal
civilian
to
make
us
think
thei
ar
extraordinari
.

none
of
thi
is
present
in
spawn
.

the
fight
sequenc
ar
weakli
execut
,
the
dialogu
is
penni-dread
and
the
art
direct
an
odiou
duplic
of
blade
runner
's
.

as
an
exampl
of
thi
film
's
vastli
creativ
imagin
the
writer
of
spawn
decid
to
includ
a
poor
orphan
boi
who
is
abandon
and
beaten
,
and
then
rescu
by
spawn
,
so
our
emot
tend
to
be
a
littl
more
sympathet
.

admittedli
,
i
did
laugh
onc
in
the
film
,
and
that
's
when
todd
mcfarlan
show
up
in
an
unexpect
cameo
as
a
bum
.

it
is
no
wonder
why
so
american
children
grow
up
with
no
engross
for
art
or
literatur
.

besid
blame
a
larg
portion
of
it
on
the
laughabl
school
system
,
i
condemn
the
other
part
to
garbag
like
spawn
.

movi
that
present
no
admir
,
no
captiv
,
no
rich
and
vagu
interest
in
what
children
ar
be
subject
to
.

and
kid
will
continu
to
see
film
like
spawn
,
simpli
becaus
thei
ar
unabl
to
differenti
what
make
an
imagin

wondrou
film
from
an
insipid
and
wast

children
