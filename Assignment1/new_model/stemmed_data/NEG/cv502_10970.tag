the
blue
brother
wa
a
wonder
film
,
a
hilari
comedi
pack
with
good
music
.

it
cri
out
for
a
sequel
,
but
john
belushi
's
untim
death
seem
to
elimin
the
idea
.

howev
,
eighteen
year
have
pass
,
and
the
long
dormant
sequel
ha
final
emerg
.

unfortun
,
it
's
a
sequel
not
worthi
of
the
origin
.

the
film
start
exactli
eighteen
year
after
the
first
on
end
.

elwood
blue
-lrb-
dan
aykroyd
-rrb-
is
just
get
out
of
jail
,
hi
brother
jake
have
recent
di
.

as
in
the
first
film
,
he
first
visit
mother
mari
stigmata
-lrb-
kathleen
freeman
-rrb-
and
then
set
about
get
the
band
back
togeth
.

john
belushi
's
absenc
leav
a
terribl
hole
in
the
film
,
and
although
three
new
charact
ar
creat
to
fill
the
void
,
it
is
still
veri
notic
.

first
,
there
's
cabel
-lrb-
joe
morton
-rrb-
the
illegitim
son
of
elwood
's
stepfath
-lrb-
plai
by
cab
callowai
in
the
first
movi
-rrb-
.

cabel
is
reluct
to
join
hi
destini
,
and
spend
most
of
the
movi
as
an
illinoi
sheriff
,
chase
the
blue
brother
band
.

next
,
there
's
mighti
mack
-lrb-
john
goodman
-rrb-
,
a
bartend
who
becom
the
new
lead
singer
of
the
band
.

final
,
there
's
buster
-lrb-
j.
evan
bonif
-rrb-
,
a
ten
year
old
orphan
who
tag
along
with
elwood
and
eventu
join
the
band
.

the
plot
of
the
film
is
hardli
origin
...
it
seem
to
be
almost
a
clone
of
the
origin
.

elwood
ha
to
go
to
reluctantli
retriev
each
member
of
the
band
,
thei
then
travel
,
while
be
pursu
by
the
polic
,
and
perform
at
sever
odd
stop
until
thei
final
reach
the
big
concert
final
.

the
first
film
had
neo-nazi
as
the
random
element
,
thi
time
around
,
the
russian
mafia
and
a
militia
group
fill
their
role
.

in
fact
,
the
duplic
of
the
plot
is
so
ridicul
complet
that
certain
scene
ar
practic
ident
to
the
origin
.

rememb
the
classic
perform
at
countri
bob
's
-lrb-
where
thei
like
both
type
of
music
:
countri
and
western
-rrb-
from
the
first
movi
?

well
,
thi
movi
ha
a
perform
at
a
countri
fair
,
where
the
band
is
expect
to
plai
bluegrass
music
.

there
's
the
massiv
polic
car
pileup
,
although
thi
time
the
gag
fall
complet
flat
.

there
's
even
an
exact
replica
of
the
convers
scene
in
the
church
of
reverend
cleophu
-lrb-
jame
brown
-rrb-
.

there
ar
plenti
of
recur
charact
too
.

in
addit
to
mother
stigmata
and
reverend
cleophu
,
aretha
franklin
repris
her
role
as
mr.
murphi
.

frank
oz
,
a
prison
guard
in
the
first
film
,
make
an
appear
here
as
the
prison
warden
.

as
the
star
,
the
new
blue
brother
do
n't
live
up
to
their
legaci
.

aykroyd
is
more
loquaci
,
yet
much
flatter
as
elwood
.

john
goodman
bare
ha
a
charact
as
mighti
mack
.

joe
morton
ha
the
deepest
charact
,
but
not
a
terribl
interest
on
,
as
cab
.

and
what
's
the
deal
with
the
orphan
?

it
plai
like
a
desper
gimmick
that
doe
n't
mesh
at
all
with
the
rest
of
the
film
.

at
least
bonif
is
n't
as
precoci
as
he
could
have
been
in
the
role
.

but
the
true
star
,
and
the
onli
save
grace
,
of
the
film
is
the
music
.

and
the
film
is
pack
with
it
-lrb-
even
dure
and
after
the
end
credit
-rrb-
.

although
there
ar
no
brilliant
merger
of
comedi
and
song
as
in
the
origin
's
rawhid/stand
by
your
man
medlei
,
the
music
is
veri
much
enjoy
.

to
top
it
off
,
the
film
is
pack
to
the
gill
with
cameo
musician
appear
.

b.b.
king
,
blue
travel
,
eric
clapton
,
travi
tritt
,
wilson
pickett
,
erykah
badu
,
bo
diddlei
and
steve
winwood
ar
just
a
sampl
of
the
multitud
of
star
that
make
an
appear
here
and
there
.

unfortun
,
the
music
paus
here
and
there
to
allow
in
the
familiar
plot
.

if
simpli
copi
the
origin
blue
brother
wa
n't
bad
enough
,
writer
aykroyd
and
john
landi
dumb
it
down
,
remov
ani
memor
charact
,
and
replac
them
with
flashi
,
but
unbeliev
,
magic
gimmick
.

it
's
a
shame
.

bui
the
soundtrack
and
avoid
the
film
.

better
yet
,
rewatch
the
origin
...
you
'll
have
a
much
better
time
.
