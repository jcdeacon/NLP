to
kidnap

of

everyth
that

doe
.

the
first
forti-five
minut
of
screw
is
harmless
entertain-a
guilti
pleasur
that
should
be
enjoy
bad
.

but
the
convolut
script
eventu
build
into
a
disast
that
is
imposs
to
bear
.

the
more
idiot
these
charact
get
,
the
more
reckless
the
script
becom
.

at
on
point
,
i
want
to
get
out
of
my
seat
and
yell
at
these
charact
:
``
no
,
you
idiot
!
''

i
'm
not
just
talk
about
willard
and
rusti
,
who
were
extrem
annoi
,
i
'm
also
talk
about
the
cop
in
thi
film
.

a
monkei
could
have
solv
thi
case
within
an
hour
but
these
gui
-lrb-
head

were
just
too
clueless
to
forgiv
.

thei
give

.

also
poor
danni
devito
appar
doe
not
know
how
to
turn
down

look
almost
ident
to
hi
penguin
in
batman
:
return
,
everi
time
he
appear
on
the
screen
i
had
to
shake
my
head
in
disbelief
.

he
just
did
n't
belong
in
thi
movi
.

macdonald
and
chapel
ar
veteran
at
these
kind
of
movi
but
devito
made
the
film
much
wors
than
it
alreadi
wa
,
gross
out
humor
is
certainli
not

if
you
're
a
fan
of

macdonald
's
other
chaotic
comedi

dirti
work
,
you
might
actual
love
