a
mere
twenti-four
hour
after
meet
her
.

thei
ar
soon
engag
,
and
max
,
becaus
of
hi
own
rage
libido
,
grow
suspici
of
samantha
's
fidel
.

he
convinc
jai
to
flirt
with
samantha
dure
the
develop
of
hi
book
,
to
``
test
her
''
.

the
troubl
is
,
jai
might
be
secretli
in
love
with
her
.

to
stretch
thi
flat
,
sitcom
premis
to
featur
length
,
the
plot
is
frame
by
a
climact
wed
,
at
which
bonni
hunt
recount
the
triangular
tale
--
the
event
lead
up
to
the
nuptial
--
to
an
annoi
fat
man
and
hi
silli
girlfriend
.

hunt
ha
the
best
comic
time
of
anyon
in
the
film
;
schwimmer
can
spin
bad
dialogu
into
mildli
humor
dialogu
;
and
lee
,
poor
lee
,
is
miscast
.

so
hyster
funni
in
chase
ami
,
here
he
is
forc
to
repress
hi
comic
instinct
:
to
swear
,
to
yell
,
to
talk
about
oral
sex
...
the
script
's
idea
of
a
charact
trait
is
to
stress
that
jai
is
a
``
sensit
man
''
,
and
then
show
him
drink
pepto
bismol
when
he
's
stew
over
hi
girl
troubl
.

as
for
avit
,
an
isra
actress
,
she
is
warm
and
sweet
,
but
we
do
n't
know
anyth
about
her
charact
other
than
that
it
take
her
an
incred
long
time
to
realiz
the
most
obviou
thing
.

she
also
too
close
resembl
the
stunningli
beauti
kari
wuhrer
,
who
plai
schwimmer
's
assist
and
person
temptress
,
turn
that
particular
subplot
into
an
unintent
riff
on
vertigo
.

there
ar
a
hand
,
a
smatter
,
of
good
scene
in
kiss
a
fool
.

i
enjoi
a
moment
in
a
comedi
club
,
dure
which
jai
get
up
and
ask
``
ha
anyon
here
ever
hate
their
girlfriend
so
much
you
want
to
kill
her
?
''

over
and
over
until
he
's
boot
off
stage
.

there
ar
also
a
few
obvious
improvis
line
that
ar
fresher
than
anyth
that
's
on
the
page
.

kiss
a
fool
is
never
as
clever
as
the
thursdai
night
joke-machin
friend
that
spawn
schwimmer
's
movi
career
,
so
save
yourself
eight
dollar
and
watch
three
episod
of
that
seri
back
to
back
.
