``

is

the
film
often
and
alwai
explod
into
warfar
without

spontan
,
stupidli
.

carpent
might
like
to
think
he
's
made
a
western
here
but
it
's
a
western
without
ani
real
hero
,
villain
,
or
border
conflict
.

it
's
just
the
shootout
minu
a
hiss
snake
plissken
.

i
never
thought
i
'd
miss
the
gui
but
i
do
.

it
's
not
*
all
*
the
same
,
howev
.

dub
the
``

the
final
exchang
between
henstridg
and
,
er
,
cube
though
is
both
audibl
*
and
*
priceless
.

mar
ha
proven
an
infertil
breed
ground
for
hollywood
in
the
last
year
or
so
,
what
with
the
stillborn
``
mission
to
mar
''
and
``
red
planet
''
-lrb-
with
val
kilmer
-rrb-
.

``
ghost
of
mar
''
sadli
add
to
those
disappoint
return
-lrb-
in
it
open
weekend
it
wa
overshadow
by
a
bunch
of
sequel
,
among
them
``
american
pie
2
''
and
``
rush
hour
2
''
-rrb-
.

the
ironi
is
that
the
mar
in
carpent
's
film
feel
sadli
absent
.

there
ar
occasion
refer
to
the
red
planet
,
of
cours
,
but
the
film
might
as
well
have
been
set
in
perth
amboi
than
on
earth
's
closest
neighbor
.

two
thing
keep
``
john
carpent
's
ghost
of
mar
''
from
get
a
huge
slap
upsid
the
head
.

1
.

henstridg
keep
her
top
on
-lrb-
miracul
-rrb-
,
and
2
.

the
film
doe
n't
pretend
to
be
anyth
it
's
not
.

what
that
mean
,
howev
,
is
that
fan
of
superior
,
intellig
,
grade
a
sci-fi/horror
ar
singularli
out
of
luck
.
