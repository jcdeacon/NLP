,
intens
perform
.

on

jaw-droppingli
aw

and

much
as

everi
onc
in
a
while
she
doe
work
that
is
reminisc
of

in
qualiti
.

hush
is
on
such
exampl
.

lang
is
so
bad
here
that
she
might
have
been
fun
to
watch
if
the
rest
of
the
film
wa
n't
such
a
prime
exampl
of
motion
pictur
tedium
.

the
film
open
,
as
mani
so-call
``
psycholog
thriller
''
do
,
by
pose
as
a
light
drama
.

we
ar
introduc
to
jackson
-lrb-
johnathon
schaech
,
last
encount
in
tom
hank
'
that
thing
you
do

-rrb-

and
helen
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
,
a
pictur
perfect
young
coupl
who
ar
veri
much
in
love
.

jackson
is
take
helen
home
for
the
holidai
so
she
can
meet
hi
mother
,
martha
-lrb-
lang
-rrb-
.

the
moment
i
first
saw
martha
,
i
start
look
for
fang
.

soon
,
the
wick
witch
of
the
east
is
plot
a
wai
for
her
son
to
get
helen
pregnant
-lrb-
thi
involv
poke
a
hole
in
a

-rrb-
.

onc
that
goal
is
accomplish
,
she
manipul
event
so
that
the
expect
coupl
move
out
of
new
york
citi
to
the

where
she

as
long
as
she
get
her
wai
,
martha
is
a
perfectli
amic
person
,
but
when
helen
defi
her
,
it
's
a
declar
of
war
.

hush
ha
three
veri
simpl
problem
:
it
's
incred
dumb
,
it
's
incred
bore
,
and
it
's
incred
predict
-lrb-
at
least
up
to
the
stupefi
end
-rrb-
.

thi
film
ha
absolut
noth
to
recommend
it
,
with
the
except
of
a
coupl
of
nice
shot
of
snow-cover
field
and
a
quick
glimps
of
gwyneth
paltrow
's
bare
buttock
.

frankli
,
it
's
embarrass
to
watch
a
respect
actress
of
lang
's
statur
give
a
perform
like
thi
--
it
's
like
a
bad
blanch
duboi
-lrb-
the
role
she
plai
in
a
1995
tv
version
of
a
streetcar
name
desir
-rrb-
.

meanwhil
,
paltrow
doe
her
best
to
get
through
her
dialogu
without
gape
at
the
stupid
of
some
of
her
line
,
and
schaech
attempt
a
passabl
imit
of
an
inanim
object
.

as
in
all
psycholog
thriller
,
the
battl
line
ar
clearli
drawn
.

here
,
it
's
mom
and
against
wife
,
with
jackson
caught
in
the
middl
.

of
cours
,
sinc
schaech
's
charact
is
poorli-develop
and
badli
act
,
it
's
imposs
to
sai
how
he
feel
about
be
in
that
situat
.

mayb
someon
should
ask
him
if
he
's
familiar
with
oedipu
.

martha
is
,
of
cours
,
the
evil
on
.

how
do
we
know
she
's
evil
?

she
smoke
cigarett
and
drink
hard
liquor
--
two
sure
sign
that
the
devil
is
at
work
.

on
the
other
hand
,
helen
is
a
good
girl
.

the
evid
for
thi
is
that
she
's
nice
to
old
ladi
and
treasur
a
locket
with
a
pictur
of
her
dead
parent
.

that
's
about
it
for
charact
develop
.

beyond
that
point
,
hush
is
just
a
seri
of
increasingli
hard-to-swallow
coincid
,
contriv
,
and
moron
plot
twist
.

howev
,
the
first
85
minut
ar
just
a
warm-up
for
the
end
,
which
is
as
anticlimact
as
it
is
profoundli
dissatisfi
.

i
ca
n't
imagin
anyon
,
no
matter
what
thei
thought
of
the
movi
as
a
whole
,
like
thi
conclus
.

either
there
wa
some
seriou
last-minut
edit
or
someon
left
out
a
few
page
of
the
script
.

befor
the
climax
,
i
dislik

;
by
the
time
the

start
,
i

thei

no

how
good

bad
it
is
.

cheat

like
thi
is
offens
and
unpardon
.

most
entri
into
thi
worn-out
,
worm-eaten
genr
ar
n't
especi
good
.

film
like
consent
adult
,
the
hand
that
rock
the
cradl
,
and
singl
white
femal
reli
on
stock
plot
and
predict

to

in

,
howev
,
thei
're
direct
with
a
degre
of

that
assur
a
level
of

.

that
's
not
the
case
with
realli
bad
thriller
like
thi
,
which
fail
to
gener
even
a
momentari

palpit
--
the
charact
ar
too
bland
and
the

is
too
uninvolv
for

.

inde

the

probabl
refer

what
