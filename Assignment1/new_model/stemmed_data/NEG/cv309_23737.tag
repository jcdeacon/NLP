both
hi

hi

brillianc
ar
mine
for
all
their
resourc

the
choic
of
duchovni
mai
have
someth
to
do
with
the
plot
,
which
could
be
fodder
for
a
valentin

dai
episod
of
``

bob

-lrb-
david
duchovni
-rrb-
lose
hi
wife
elizabeth
-lrb-
joeli
richardson
-rrb-
in
a

at

time
,
grace

minni
driver
-rrb-
is
in
the
hospit
,
wait
for
a
heart
transplant
.

grace
get
elizabeth
's
heart
,
and
it
lead
her
to
bob
.

it
's
the
romant
equival
of
all
those
horror
film
where
someon
get
a
transplant
from
a
serial
killer
and
then
is
driven
to
slaughter

,
``

add
littl
to
the
``
boi

/

''
formula
and
,
as
a
result
,
is
terribl
tediou
and
slow-move
.

duchovni
and
driver
seem
unabl
to
gener
ani

,
and
i
kept
wish
for
a
fast-forward
button
to
move
their
scene
along
.

sinc

ha
manag
to
work
well
in

role
befor
,
i
blame
duchovni
.

he
's
out
of
hi
element
without
the
manufactur
and
static
sexual
tension
of
hi
tv
seri
-lrb-
and
i
've
alwai
thought
that
the
relationship
between
mulder
and
sculli
on
``
the
x-file
''
come
off
more
sibl-like
than
hot-and-bother
-rrb-
.

there
's
someth
about
duchovni
that
make
me
uneasi
.

regardless
of
the
role
he
's
plai
,
he
come
off
as
a
weirdo
.

the
onli
redeem
qualiti
of
``
return
to
me
''
is
it
hilari
support
cast
.

the
circl
of

rel
around
bob
and
grace
is
constantli
plai

,
and
thei
gener
the
onli

carrol

when

begin
quizz

about

when

discov
that

he
invit
bob
to
join
hi

game
and
introduc
him
with
the
declar
,
``

the
