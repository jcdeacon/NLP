thei
seem

of

i
must

at

i

not
believ
how
littl

happen
over

the

rememb
a
littl
film
call
jaw
?

in
thi
film
,
three
independ-mind
men
suddenli
found
themselv
on
a
fish
boat
in
pursuit
of
a
deadli
shark
.

thei
did
n't
much
like
each
other
at
first
;
eventu
,
thei
start
to
respect
on
anoth
.

on
of
jaw
'
great
scene
involv
the
would-be-ahab
drink
and
sing
song
and
tell
stori
.

thi
is
the
sort
of
male-bond
foreign
to
bai
or
hi
produc
,
jerri
bruckheim
,
who
throw
too
mani
charact
into
the
mix
and
expect
we
'll
care
about
them
on
the
ground
that
the
world
is
about
to
end
.

not
onc
do
we
get
the
feel
that
these
charact
ar
even
acquaint-i
'd
be
surpris
if
these
actor
bother
to
introduc
themselv
to
on
anoth
befor
``
action
''
wa
call
.

a
male
friend
who
love
the
film
suggest
to
me
that
perhap
i
can
not
relat
to
a
bunch
of
men
who
do
n't
bare
their
soul
,
who
believ
in
dy
macho
concept
like
heroism
and
a
kind
of
chest-beat
braveri
.

to
thi
,
i
will
respond
that
the
boi
in
armageddon
ar
neither
heroic
,
nor
brave
,
nor
smart
,
even
:
thi
team
could
n't
build
a
birdhous
.

and
if
i
get
no
respect
for
dislik
a
movi
with
all
the
synthet
feel
of
a
trailer-a
trailer
for
a
movi
written
by
a
team
of
bodi-builder
and
greet
card
author-i
've
never
been
a
prouder
wimp
my
whole
life
.
