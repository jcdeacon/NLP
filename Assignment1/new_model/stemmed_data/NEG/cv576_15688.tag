it
is
a
perfect
exampl
of
the
exact
reason
why

,
and
that
is
becaus
thei
reach
for
the
lowest-common-denomin
in
filmmak
,
favor
non-stop
death
and
gore
for
suspens
,
and
trade

although
often
paranoid
and
haunt
by
bad
dream
,
she

been
abl
to

it
is
the
last

of
the
open

,
and

of

juli
,
her
friend
,
and
the
worker
ar
n't
the
onli
on
there
,
as
the
murder
ben
willi
,
dress
in
fisherman
garb
,
return
to
seek
reveng
on
juli
onc
and
for
all
.

it
is
a
sad
state
of
affair
when
a
movi
like
,
``
i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
,
''
is
made
.

i
am
a
veri
big
fan
of
horror
movi
,
and
so
it
is
especi
dishearten
to
find
out
that
thi
sequel
to
``
ikwydl
,
''
which
i
am
a
fan
of
,
is
almost
an
exact
replica
of
a
``
fridai
the
13th
''
movi
.

while
the
origin
focus
more
on
the
stori
and
charact
,
as
well
as
genuin
suspens
moment
,
thank
to
the
screenplai
by
kevin
williamson
-lrb-
who
did
n't
return
to
write
the
sequel
,
and
it
show
-rrb-
,
``
i
still
know
...
''
ha
no
stori
to
speak
of
,
and
is
so
vacuou
of
idea
,
that
the
filmmak
,
were
forc
to
have
a
murder
occur
everi
five
minut
just
to
keep
the
audienc
interest
.

also
gone
ar
ani
sign
of
charact
develop
,
and
sinc
everi
singl
charact
di
befor
i
got
to
know
them
,
all
i
wa
left
with
wa
to
stare
at
the
screen
,
indiffer
to
what
wa
go
on
.

while
i
care
about
the
fate
of
the
charact
in
the
origin
,
it
made
no
differ
to
me
in
thi
sequel
who
live
and
di
.

thei
were
all
paper-thin
and
pointless
,
except
to
becom
victim
to
the
lethal
hook
of
the
fisherman
.

anoth
element
that
made
the
origin
so
memor
were
some
superbl
craft
set-piec
,
like
the
store
sequenc
with
sarah
michel
gellar
,
but
there
ar
none
to
speak
of
in
thi
sequel
-lrb-
although
thei
do
come
close
at
on
moment
with
brandi
-rrb-
.

sinc
so
mani
peopl
were
kill
everi
coupl
minut
,
the
suspens
and
scare
evapor
faster
than
salt
in
water
.

also
of
note
is
the
mysteri
of
the
second
killer
,
and
accomplic
to
ben
,
but
it
is
obviou
from
the
first
frame
who
it
is
,
and
so
i
could
n't
even
have
fun
at
that
,
like
i
did
in
the
``
scream
''
movi
and
,
``
urban
legend
.
''

it
figur
that
just
as
slasher
film
were
start
to
get
some
recognit
again
,
a
film
would
come
along
and
ruin
it
for
everyon
els
.

mayb
the
peopl
who
made
,
``
i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
,
''
should
have
realiz
that
in
order
to
make
a
good
movi
,
you
must
have
a
screenplai
--
or
at
least
on
that
is
n't
such
a
black
hole
for
thought
and
idea
.

the
end
of
the
film
inevit
leav
the
door
wide
open
for
a
third
part
,
but
judg
from
thi
amazingli
lacklust
first
sequel
,
everyon
involv
should
have
quit
while
thei
were
still
ahead
.
