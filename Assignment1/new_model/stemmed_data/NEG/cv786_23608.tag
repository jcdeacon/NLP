``
mission
to
mar
''
is
on
of
those
annoi
movi
where
,
in
the
middl
of
the
movi
,
you
get
the
sneak
suspicion
that
the
reason
the
trailer
look
so
good
is
becaus
thei
showcas
all
the
best
part
of
the
movi
:
all
five
minut
of
it
.

``
mission
''
doe
give
you
payoff
;
but
when
it
doe
come
,
it
's
too
littl
,
too
late
.

``
mission
''
ha
some
good
idea
,
but
thei
get
lost
in
the
unbear
bore
deliveri
,
dime-a-dozen
dialogu
,
and
spate
of
good
actor
wast
in
cardboard-cutout
role
.

i
'm
sure
the
director
and
writer
were
veri
proud
of
each
hallmark
moment
thei
came
up
with
,
so
thei
stretch
each
dramat
moment
out
like
silli
putti
until
it
lose
all
it
charm
.

glanc
do
n't
commun

emot
just
becaus
you
draw
them
out
for
five
hour
on
end
.

the
film
spend
an
hour
on
thi
kind
of
stuff
,
build
to
it
climax
.

a
lot
of
it
is
a
clich
glorif
of
famili
relationship
,
marriag
,
friendship
,
unit
we
stand
divid
we
fall
kind
of
crap
.

there
ar
some
spectacular

sequenc
in
thi
film
,
and
i

the
sequenc
with
the
martian
demonstr
their

is
oddli
beauti

,
but
as
mention
by
then
we
're
so
sick
of
the
goddamn
thing
we
want
the
movi
to
be
over
.

great
design
,
good
intent
,
but
no
