hollywood
is
just
anoth
exampl
,
with
it
revisionist
western
,
made
in
earli
1990s
.

those
movi
tri

exploit
the
emerg

of
polit
correct
,
coincid
with
the
500th
anniversari
of

on
of
such
exampl
is
geronimo

an
american

,
1993
western
direct
by
walter

,
film
that
deal
with
on
of
the
last
conflict
between
american
nativ
and
white

.

the
hero
of
the
film
is
geronimo

plai
by
we

leader
of

fierc
warrior
tribe
that

when
the
movi

in

,
geronimo
and
hi
apach
made
peac
with

try

in

howev
,
broken

make
geronimo
restless

with
not

30

respect

and
know
that
even
hi
5,000
forc
is
n't
enough
to
catch
geronimo
in
the
great
space
of
the
american
southwest
.

instead
,
he
turn
to

ar

geronimo
:
an
american
legend
,
like
mani
movi
made
under
the
shadow
of
polit
correct
,
try
to
tell
the
tale
about
oppress
minor
,
but
instead
the
real
subject
is
the
bad
conscienc
of
the
oppressor
.

so
,
the
stori
about
geronimo
is
told
from
the
perspect
of
hi
enemi
.

almost
all
of
them
happen
to
be
hi
greatest
admir
and
us
everi
opportun
to
express
how
sorri
thei
feel
for
have
to
fight
him
and
hi
peopl
.

although
such
element
of
john
milliu
'
screenplai
do
inde
have
some
basi
in
histori
,
thei
harm
the
stori
of
geronimo
.

to
be
honest
,
walter
hill
doe
try
to
make
geronimo
the
real
hero
of
the
film
,
but
the
movi
segment
that
deal
with
the
plight
of
apach
and
the
upris
ar
given
too
littl
time
.

instead
,
thei
turn
out
to
be
noth
more
than
the
back
stori
for
rather
uninterest
adventur
stori
of
gatewood
and
hi
band
.

to
make
even
wors
,
hill
ha
some
real
problem
with
pace
and
style
,
and
in
the
end
we
have
impress
that
we
ar
watch
two
film
badli
edit
into
on-stori
about
geronimo
and
stori
about
hi
pursuer
.

the
movi
should
have
been
better
if
it
turn
to
geronimo
's
life
befor
and
after
hi
last
upris
,
in
mani
wai
more
interest
than
the
stori
about
gatewood
.

the
differ
between
those
segment
could
be
observ
through
the
differ
qualiti
of
act
.

we
studi
,
cheroke
actor
who
wa
so
impress
as
magua
in
the
last
of
the
mohican
,
wa
perfect
choic
for
geronimo
,
not
onli
becaus
he
resembl
geronimo
,
but
becaus
he
induc
a
lot
of
passion
in
hi
role
.

contrari
to
him
,
we
have
disinterest
actor
who
sleepwalk
through
the
role
of
hi
white
enemi
.

while
thi
could
be
expect
from
someon
like
jason
patric
,
it
is
shame
when
we
have
veteran
like
gene
hackman
or
robert
duval
.

even
hill
's
direct
is
bellow
expect-battl
scene
ar
too
short
and
,
like
in
mani
of
hi
late
film
,
forc
viewer
to
ask
what
had
happen
to
the
great
action
director
of
1970s
.

even
hi
old
associ
,
music
compos
ry
cooder
,
disappoint
,
with
the
score
that
shift
between
indian
motiv
and
classic
.

on
the
other
hand
,
photographi
by
lloyd
ahern
ii
,
with
the
us
of
red
lens
,
give
somewhat
dreami
atmospher
,
ideal
for
thi
movi
that
wa
suppos
to
be
melanchol
epic
.

all
in
all
,
compar
with
some
of
the
hollywood
's
exampl
of
polit
correct
,
thi
film
is
n't
so
bad
,
but
we
ar
left
with
the
unpleas
impress
that
it
could
have
been
better
.
