of

doe

not
?

after
the
first
fifteen
minut
,
it
quickli
becom
appar
that
it
is
not
.

the
mod
squad
is
certainli
a
slick
look
product
,
complet
with
nice
hair
and
costum
,
but
that
simpli
is
n't
enough
.

the
film
is
best
describ
as
a
cross
between
an
hour-long
cop
show
and
a
music
video
,
both
stretch
out
into
the
span
of
an
hour
and
a
half
.

and
with
it
come
everi
singl
clich
.

it
doe
n't
realli
matter
that
the
film
is
base
on
a
televis
show
,
as
most
of
the
plot
element
have
been
recycl
from
everyth
we
've
alreadi
seen
.

the
charact
and
act
is
noth
spectacular
,
sometim
even
border

the
onli

worth
watch
.

unfortun
,
even
he
's
not
enough
to
save
thi
convolut
mess
,
as
all
the
charact
do
n't
do
much
apart
from
occupi
screen
time
.

with
the
young
cast
,
cool
cloth
,
nice
hair
,
and
hip
soundtrack
,
it
appear
that
the
film
is
gear
toward
the
teenag
mindset
.

despit

-lrb-
which
the
content
doe
not

-rrb-
,
the
film
is
wai
too
juvenil
for
the
older
mindset
.

inform

the

liter
spoon-fed
to
the

-lrb-
would
it
be
that
hard
to
show
us
instead
of
tell
us
?
-rrb-

,
dialogu
is
poorli
written
,
and
the
plot
is

the
wai
the

progress
,
you

n't
even
care
if
the

becaus
you

base
the
show
on
a
1960
's
televis
show
that
nobodi

is
of
question
wisdom
,
especi
when
on
consid
the

the
fact
that
the

the

is
a
clear
indic
that
thi

it
is
clear
that
the
film
is
noth
more
than
an
attempt
to
cash
