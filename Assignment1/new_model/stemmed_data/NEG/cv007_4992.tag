's
a
terribl
mess
of
a

star
a
terribl
mess
of
a
man
,
mr.
hugh
grant
,
a
huge

not
the
whole
oral-sex/prostitut
thing
-lrb-
refer
to
grant
,
not
me
-rrb-
that
bug
me
,
it
's
the
fact
that

annoi
.

not

sinc
when
do
ey
flutter
and
nervou
smile
pass
for

?

but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
sinc
when
do
realli
bad
slapstick
-lrb-
a
fistfight
in
the
deliveri
room
culmin
in
grant

-rrb-
pass
for
comedi
?

nine
month
is
a
predict
cooki-cutter
movi
with
no
origin
in
humor
or
plot
.

hugh
grant
plai

more
like
a
hugh

besid
the
point
,
which
is
:
nine

includ
too

needlessli
stupid
joke
that
get
laugh
from

the
annoi
friend
is
plai
by
tom
arnold
,
who
provid
most
of
the
cacophon
slapstick
,
none
of
which
is
funni
,
such
as
a
scene
where
arnold
beat
up
a
costum
``
arni

-lrb-
you
draw
your
own
parallel
on
that
on

the
onli

by
jeff

,
who
should
have
