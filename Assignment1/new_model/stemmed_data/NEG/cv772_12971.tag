gee
,
what
ar
the
odd
their

poor
patillo
ha
been
try
to
get
ahead
in
the
new
busi
for
year
but
ha
been
held
down
by
heartless
anchorman
harri
shearer
.

italian
cameraman
hank
azaria
tell
her
she
's
not
ruthless
enough
:
``
nice

it

actual
,
it

eat
citi
,
as
godzilla
emerg
from
the
atlant
to
begin
a
rampag
on
the
big
appl
's
core
.

the
filmmak
provid
us
with
a
on-note
drunk
fisherman
who
hook
godzilla
.

``
i
think
i
've
got
a
bite
,
''
he
announc
as
a
gigant
tidal
wave
begin
rush
toward
him
.

you
can
guess
what
happen
next
.

similar
reaction
spring
forth
as
the
monster
prowl
the
citi
.

hear
the
rumbl
of
approach
footstep
,
on
new
yorker
remark
,
``
pleas
do
n't
tell
me
that
's
anoth
parad
.
''

pleas
do
n't
tell
me
that
's
the
best
line
you
could
come
up
with
.

mayor
ebert
is
not
pleas
.

plai
by
the
princip
from
``
head
of
the
class
,
''
he
continu
make
the
wrong
decis
when
given
an
option
,
and
bicker
with
hi
assist
gene
.

i
guess
the
filmmak
knew
thei
'd
be
get
two
thumb
down
from
the
critic
and
did
n't
even
bother
to
kiss
ass
.

the
problem
is
,
if
you
're
go
to
attack
siskel
and
ebert
,
you
should
at
least
make
it
funni
.

dialogu
like
,
``
did
n't
we
agre
that
we
were
n't
go
to
have
ani
sweet
until
after
the
elect
?
''

follow
by
,
``
back
off
,
gene
,
''
just
doe
n't
work
for
me
.

other
lame
run
joke
includ
everyon
mispronounc
the
broderick
charact
's
last
name
and
frenchman
jean
reno
's
inabl
to
find
a
good
cup
of
coffe
in
new
york
.

there
's
even
more
fun
to
be
had
as
godzilla
progress
.

as
the
beast
head
back
into
hide
,
broderick
suggest
the
militari
lure
it
out
with
food
.

cue
twelv
dump
truck
,
all
drop
fish
into
a
new
york
intersect
.

-lrb-
broderick
:
that
's
a
lot
of
fish
.
-rrb-

that
ambush
fail
,
but
broderick
soon
figur
out
why
godzilla
came
to
new
york
by
bui
$
50
worth
of
home
pregnanc
test
and
run
lizard
blood
through
them
.

yep
,
godzilla
's
with
children
,
which
make
you
wonder
just
what
kind
of
creatur
would
be
horni
enough
to
have
sex
with
godzilla
.

that
's
until
broderick
explain
that
godzilla
reproduc
asexu
,
like
linda
tripp
.

godzilla
come
to
us
from
the
maker
of
independ
dai
,
so
it
ha
a
lot
of
dumb
action
scene
,
destruct
special
effect
and
shallow
subplot
.

look
no
further
than
patillo
's
betray
of
broderick
-lrb-
patillo
:
what
have
i
done
,
anim
?

what
have
i
becom
?
-rrb-

and
the
climact
``
godzilla
's
nest
''
sequenc
in
madison
squar
garden
.

the
main
differ
is
,
independ
dai
wa
about
the
experi
.

it
had
a
real
global
,
patriot
element
to
it
,
and
some
genuin
fun
charact
.

godzilla
ha
lot
of
rain
and
lightn
,
reptilian
action
rip
off
from
jurass
park
and
endless
product
placement
from
the
like
of
kodak
,
blockbust
,
juici
fruit
,
swatch
,
sprint
and
bumbl
bee
tuna
.

ye
,
bumbl
bee
actual
paid
to
be
known
as
the
offici
tuna
of
godzilla
.

that
fact
alon
is
twice
as
interest
as
anyth
in
the
movi
.
