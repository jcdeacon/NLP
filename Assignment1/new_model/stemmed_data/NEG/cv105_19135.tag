base
on
the
1960s
tv
seri
that
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
befor
thi
movi
-lrb-
be
happi
,
i
wo
n't
bore
you
with
ani
lame
and
unnecessari
comparison
-rrb-
,
thi
film
allow
will
smith
to
take
a
third
stab
at
the
independ
dai
weekend
box-offic
,
after
score
huge
success
with
men
in
black
,
direct
by
the
same
man
who
control
thi
on
,
and
independ
dai
.

can
you
sai
...
the
third
time
not
a
charm
?

jame
west
and
artemu
gordon
ar
chosen
by
the
presid
to
find
the
man
respons
for
the
kidnap
of
the
nation
's
top
scientist
,
and
threaten
to
take
over
the
unit
state
within
a
week
.

i
did
not
laugh
onc
dure
thi
entir
pictur
.

when
you
consid
that
thi
film
is
a
part-comedi
,
that
's
not
a
veri
good
sign
.

i
also
did
not
tens
up
or
particularli
enjoi
ani
of
it
unenerget
action
sequenc
which
provid
me
with
littl
more
than
a
few
minut
time
to
think
back
to
the
love
salma
hayek
scene
.

when
you
consid
that
the
other
``
part
''
of
thi
film
is
gear
as
an
action/adventur
,
i
would
sai
that
thi
anoth
neg
sign
.

and
when
you
consid
that
the
first
hour
of
the
film
wa
bore
and
a
littl
slow
,
the
stori-line
tire
,
reminisc
of
swiss
chees
and
uninvolv
,
and
the
special
effect
interest
but
worth
veri
littl
insid
a
plot
fill
with
lame
on-liner
,
weak
character
and
an
anti-climact
end
,
you
pretti
much
have
the
gist
of
my
impress
of
thi
``
big
''
summer
blockbust
.

it
blow
.

or
as
thei
sai
in
french
,
``
eet
blow
''
.

could
it
be
that
the
script
wa
crappi
becaus
it
took
four
peopl
to
write
it
?

mayb
.

could
it
be
that
most
of
the
special
effect
do
n't
show
up
until
the
last
half
hour
,
and
even
then
,
we
do
n't
see
anyth
that
it
trailer
had
n't
alreadi
given
awai
?

perhap
.

or
could
it
be
that
we
have
come
to
expect
so
much
more
from
will
smith
and
hollywood
big-budget
movi
,
that
we
can
not
help
but
evalu
them
on
a
scale
onto
their
own
?

naaaaaaah
!

a
bad
movi
is
a
bad
movi
.

on
a
posit
note
,
i
could
honestli
sai
that
i
did
veri
much
enjoi
the
love
perform
by
the
ador
salma
hayek
,
who
seem
underus
-lrb-
in
my
humbl
opinion
-rrb-
,
and
lit
up
everi
bubbl
scene
that
she
wa
hardli
in
.

branagh
wa
also
fun
as
the
sceneri-munch
,
over-the-top
bad
gui
,
but
that
's
pretti
much
where
the
entertain-buck
stop
.

smith
and
kline
were
static
at
best
,
the
plot
full
of
hole
,
and
the
score
insignific
and
deriv
of
a
dozen
other
.

i
would
strongli
advis
anyon
not
to
see
thi
movi
.

then
again
,
there
is
that
on
scene
with
the
love
salma
hayek
ti
up
in

cage
