facial
express
of
the
charact
and
the
absurd
of
the
situat
.

a
veri
minor
farc
that
might
appeal
to
the
sitcom
crowd
.

the
film
just
did
n't
take
it
situat
serious
and
the
stori
had
mani
gap
in
it
,
so
it
had
no
chanc
for
black
humor
to
develop
.

it
instead
plai
it
set-up
of
the
henpeck
husband
act
out
hi
fantasi
strictli
for

valu
to
