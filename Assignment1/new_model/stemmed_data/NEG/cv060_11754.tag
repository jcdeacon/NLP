on
of
the
most
respect
name
in
american
independ
filmmak
is
john
sayl
.

he
ha
built
a
strong
reput
with
film
like
matewan
and
the
secret
of
roan
inish
,
and
on
of
hi
best
wa
hi
last
film
,
lone
star
.

after
sayl
gave
us
thi
complex
and
unconvent
look
at
ethnic
tension
on
the
us-mexico
border
,
expect
ran
high
for
hi
next
film
.

unfortun
,
hi
men
with
gun
is
not
the
film
anyon
wa
hope
for
.

we
ar
essenti
told
in
the
first
reel
where
the
film
is
go
to
go
and
what
it
is
go
to
do
.

then
the
film
doe
exactli
what
it
promis
,
a
pain
as
that
is
.

the
plot
of
men
with
gun
can
be
summar
``
in
a
central
or
south
american
countri
thing
ar
realli
bad
for
everybodi
in
the
mountain
where
the
armi
clash
with
the
guerrilla
.
''

dr.
fuent
did
not
believ
how
bad
thing
were
so
he
went
.

and
he
found
out
again
and
again
and
again
.
''
''

of
cours
it
is
perfectli
true
that
in
mani
place
in
that
region
arm
conflict
have
turn
life
into
a
live
hell
.

a
guerrilla
war
is
alwai
bad
for
civilian
.

but
the
film
talk
down
to
the
viewer
.

dr.
fuent
-lrb-
plai
by
federico
luppi
-rrb-
teach
medicin
in
the
capit
citi
of
hi
countri
.

he
ha
,
as
a
great
humanitarian
gestur
,
train
and
inspir
some
of
hi
best
student
to
go
into
the
mountain
and
make
the
world
a
littl
better
for
the
poor
indio
.

fuent
believ
the
student
to
be
up
there
do
humanitarian
servic
.

then
he
discov
on
of
hi
best
student
ha
instead
return
to
the
citi
and
run
a
squalid
privat
pharmaci
.

in
shame
and
disappoint
fuent
ask
the
student
what
ha
happen
to
the
other
.

the
student
tell
him
the
other
ar
still
in
the
mountain
,
but
suggest
that
it
mai
not
be
a
good
place
to
be
.

fuent
goe
off
to
find
and
visit
the
doctor
,
ignor
the
advic
of
hi
famili
and
a
patient
who
happen
to
be
an
armi
gener
.

the
result
ar
littl
differ
than
on
would
expect
.

dr.
fuent
start
out
incred
naiv
.

even
some
american
tourist
,
present
in
the
film
mostli
for
comic
relief
,
seem
to
know
better
than
dr.
fuent
that
thing
have
gotten
pretti
bad
in
the
mountain
.

but
fuent
ha
to
go
from
on
scene
of
barbar
to
anoth
and
discov
how
wrong
he
wa
.

sayl
certainli

126
minut
of
screen
time
to
tell
us
someth
more
profound
than
that
nasti
thing

happen
down

and
most
of
the
worst
happen
to
the
unarm
civilian
.

the
