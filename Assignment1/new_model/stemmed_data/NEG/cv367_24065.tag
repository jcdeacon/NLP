requir
that
a
potenti
viewer
be
under
a
certain

iq
in

to
see

there
ar
probabl
quit
a

peopl
who
ar
go
to
enjoi
it

and
most
of

will
probabl
be
those
who
have
seen
veri

of
it
kind

but
there
ar
those
who

all

``
mission
to

''
is
on
of
those
film
that
make
a
critic
wonder
where
to
start
when
talk
about
all
the
thing
that
ar
wrong
with
it
,
so
let
's
start
with
on
of
the
thing
that
doe
work
:
director
brian
de
palma
manag
to
creat
some
eeri
tension
in
a
few
scene
dure
the
middl
of
the
film
.

that
's
it
.

everyth
els
fail
.

the
failur
is
n't
de
palma
's
fault
;
he
's
work
from
an
atroci
script
.

onli
dure
the
sequenc
aboard
the
ship
-lrb-
look
an
aw
lot
like
the
jupit
vessel
in
``
2001
''
-rrb-
where
the
rescu
team
's
air
begin
run
out
and
thei
must
frantic
search
for
the
hole
and
patch
it
up
doe
``
mission
to
mar
''
come
to
life
.

a
scene
where
thei
attempt
to
save
a
comrad
float
awai
into
space
also
provid
some
tension
,
until
you
realiz
that
the
entir
danger/more
danger/attempt
rescu
sequenc
ha
absolut
noth
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
film
;
it
's
just
a
contriv
wai
to
gener
thrill
scene
.

take
it
out
,
and
the
plot
is
n't
affect
in
ani
wai
.

the
sequenc
also
suffer
from
a
few
plot
hole
-lrb-
as
doe
the
rest
of
the
film
-rrb-
:
why
is
the
ship
's
comput
-lrb-
which
sound
strang
like
hal
from
,
uh
,
``
2001
''
-rrb-
abl
to
detect
a
hole
in
the
main
chamber
but
not
on
in
the
engin
?

why
did
tim
robbin
'
charact
have
to
go
outsid
the
ship
when
the
solut
easili
present
itself
from
insid
?

should
n't
the
astronaut
be
better
train
to
deal
with
a
hull
breach
?

why
ar
the
charact
such
idiot
?

becaus
the
script
make
littl
attempt
to
properli
develop
them
.

all
the
``
conflict
''
is
clumsili
deliv
in
excruciatingli
obviou
exposit
in
the
open
scene
-lrb-
which
rip
off
orson
well
and
robert
altman
by
util
a
long
open
track
shot
-rrb-
dure
which
the
charact
repeatedli
tell
each
other
about
thing
all
of
them
should
alreadi
know
:
``
jim
,
it
's

''
--
doe
anyon
realli
talk
like
thi
?

ca
n't
we
find
out
these
thing
in
a
less
grate
matter
,
like
mayb
in
a
flashback
?

the
whole
film
is
like
that
.

the
filmmak
ar
not
content
to
mere
show
us
someth
and
assum
we
know
what
's
go
on
;
thei
must

tell

us
exactli
what
we

it

all

ha
been

and
those
