ha
hi

's
knack
for

up

but
none
of

skill
in

the

.

most
of
the
action
scene
ar
film
in
such
a
rapid
,
jerki
wai
that
it
's
imposs
to
comprehend
what
's
go
on
.

the
camerawork
is
even
more
nauseat
than
in
the
purposefulli
dizzi
the
blair
witch
project
due
to
it
lack
of

instead
of
util

he
bare
ever
hold
a
shot
for
more
than
ten
second
and
dure
the
faster
scene
it
seem
more
like
a
coupl
frame
between
each
cut
.

the
weird
,
almost
defiant
lack
of

ar

-rrb-
undermin
charact
definit
and
our
two
protagonist
come
off
as
cipher
rather
than
charact
.

the
love
affair
between
maclean
and
rebecca
is
no
differ
,
emotionless
and
unrealist
.

when
the
script
call
for
maclean
to
decid
between
go
to
america
and
go
to
meet
hi
lover
,
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
believ
it
would
be
worth
it
for
him
to
abandon
hi
goal
;
he
and
rebecca
bare
even
speak
to
each
other
throughout
the
film
.

plunkett
and
maclean
want
desper
to
be
a
triumph
of
style
over
substanc
but
sinc
it
style
,
quit
frankli

blow
,
the
film
ha
no
hope
of
succeed
on

level

i
want
