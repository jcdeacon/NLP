suicid
is
pointless
,
everyon
should
know
that
.

so
what
's
thi
movi
like
?

you
guess
it
...
pointless
.

the
virgin
suicid
focus
on
the
live
of
the
five
lisbon
sister
,
from
the
perspect
of
the
teenag
boi
who
ar
fascin
by
them
.

when
the
youngest
lisbon
sister
commit
suicid
,
it
set
in
motion
a
seri
of
event
that
will
chang
the
live
of
mani
peopl
forev
.

that
's
what
the
press
materi
for
the
film
probabl
sai
.

now
here
's
what
i
sai
:
the
virgin
suicid
is
a
huge
wast
of
time
.

bore
,
arti
,
pretenti
junk
that
is
about
as
entertain
as
...
well
as
commit
suicid
.

the
movi
lost
me
earli
on
,
immedi
follow
the
scene
where
the
younger
daughter
jump
to
her
death
from
her
bedroom
window
.

the
girl
's
father
-lrb-
jame
wood
-rrb-
hold
her
lifeless
bodi
in
hi
arm
as
their
horrifi
famili
look
on
.

then
,
as
the
scene
end
,
the
lawn
sprinkler
come
on
.

is
that
a
joke
?

is
that
suppos
to
be
amus
in
some
wai
?

from
then
on
,
the
movi
fail
to
draw
me
back
in
.

perform
ar
the
onli
save
grace
of
the
virgin
suicid
.

wood
plai
the
onli
charact
who
would
actual
interest
me
when
he
came
onscreen
,
but
the
perform
of
kirsten
dunst
as
the
next
youngest
daughter
lux
is
worth
mention
as
well
.

dunst
ha
the
potenti
to
be
a
big
star
,
if
she
choos
her
project
well
.

and
while
thi
film
is
aw
,
she
manag
to
come
awai
from
it
virtual
unscath
.

there
ar
also
a
few
cameo
in
the
film
here
and
there
,
which
onli
frustrat
the
audienc
as
thei
leav
you
want
more
.

as
a
result
,
thei
all
seem
rather
pointless
-lrb-
although
there
's
a
brief
role
given
to
michael
pare
from
eddi
and
the
cruiser
which
turn
out
to
be
hi
best
role
sinc
...
well
sinc
eddi
and
the
cruiser
-rrb-
.

perhap
the
virgin
suicid
would
have
work
had
the
stori
not
been
told
from
the
point
of
view
of
peopl
who
had
veri
littl
access
to
the
main
charact
.

we
never
get
ani
signific
insight
into
the
girl
and
why
thei
might
be
feel
what
thei
're
feel
.

all
we
realli
know
is
that
mr.
lisbon
-lrb-
kathleen
turner
-rrb-
is
strict
and
keep
them
on
a
short
leash
.

what
mother
doe
n't
?

it
's
certainli
no
reason
to
commit
suicid
.

with
the
godfath
part
iii
,
sofia
coppola
prove
that
she
had
no
busi
be
in
front
of
the
camera
.

with
the
virgin
suicid
,
she
prove
she
ha
no
busi
behind
it
either
.

have
famili
connect
doe
n't
entitl
you
to
be
allow
to
make
movi
.

so
attent
film
director
...
stop
let
your
daughter
pout
their
wai
into
the
industri
.

just
becaus
thei
share
your
dna
doe
n't
mean
thei
share
your
talent
.
