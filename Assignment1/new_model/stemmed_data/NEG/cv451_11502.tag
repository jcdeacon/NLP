the

of
which
appear
to
have
given
``

a
send-off
that
's
downright
infuri
.

it
's
too
bad
that
``
hush
''
is
so
laughabl
,
becaus
the
on-screen
talent
--
includ
the
pair
of
gwyneth
paltrow
and
jessica

is
noth
to
laugh
at

take
place
while
helen
is
in
the
altogeth
,
caught
red-hand
after
a
bedroom
romp
with
her
husband-to-be
.

but
it
seem
that
martha
's
friendli
smile
mask
a
much
more
threaten
demeanor
;
she
's
what
you
'd
call

who

then

if
there

it

she

it

the
rest
of
the

look
ill
and
uncomfort

especi
paltrow
.

but
can
you
realli
blame
them
?

the
charact
relationship
in
``

hold
a
certain
amount
of
promis
,
at
least
until
their
psycholog

is
blown
out
of

sheer
stupid

and
the
film
take
the
form
of
on
of
the
shoddier
fill
in
the
blank-from-hell
flick
ever
made
.

you
can
see
through
a
great
deal
of
martha
's
action
and
li
from
their
concept
;
why
do
peopl
who

if

thought

,
``

would
be
a

and
then
there
's
the
climax

which
abruptli
come

no

perhap
``
