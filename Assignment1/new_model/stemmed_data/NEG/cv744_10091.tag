and
the
onli
thing
he
ha
go
for
him
is
termin
cute
.

he
's
not
half
as
interest
as
macaulai
culkin

.

the
villain
,
pale
copi
of
joe
pesci
and
daniel
stern
,
ar
even
less
engag
than
the
pair
of
idiot
in

.

in
home

,
there
ar
four
of
them
-lrb-
olek

,
david
thornton
,
lenni
von

and
rya

,
but
all
that
mean
is
an
opportun
for
twice

thi
time
,
the
kid
is
n't
left
home
alon
becaus
hi

have
gone
on
a

.

instead

so
he
ca

and
hi

so
,
for
the
most
part
,
he
's
all
by

through

the
movi

a

previous
,
the
most
counterfeit-look
snow

i
can
rememb
were
in

.

these
ar
far
wors
.

in
fact
,
the
product
valu
ar
so
shoddi
that
there
ar
some
scene
in
the
midst
of
thi
near-blizzard
when
a
shine
sun
can
be
seen
.

if
it
's
a
wonder
life
could
gener
real-look
snow
back
in
the
1940s
,
why
ca
n't
home
alon
3
,
which
ha
a
significantli
larger
budget
and
'
90s
technolog
at
it
dispos
?

there
ha
been
an
ongo
debat
regard
the
appropri
of
live-action
cartoon
violenc
for
young
children
.

home
alon
3
will
add
fuel
to
the
fire
.

it
's
on
thing
to
see
wyle
e.
coyot
flatten
by
a
10
ton
acm
weight
,
but
quit
anoth
to
watch
a
run
lawn
mower
fall
on
lenni
von
dohlen
.

adult
and
even
older
children
will
recogn
that
thi
is
obvious
fake
and
intend
to
be
humor
,
but
what
about
five
and
six-year
old
?

the
level
of
violenc
in
home
alon
3
is
extrem
mani
of
alex
's
scheme
ar
nasti
enough
to
kill
.

but
,
becaus
thi
is
a
``
famili
film
,
''
no
on
di
,
despit
be
electrocut
,
fall
thirti
feet
,
and
get
smack
on
the
head
by
a
barbel
.

not
onli
is
home
alon

unnecessari
,
but
it
's
offens
.

it
's
an
exercis
in
tedious
,
and
there
is
n't
a
genuin
laugh
to
be
found
from
the
begin
to
the
end
-lrb-
unless
,
by
some
strang
quirk
of
fate
,
you
have
miss
everi
1990s
movi
associ
with
john
hugh
,
and
thu
have
n't
seen
thi
stuff
befor
-rrb-
.

i
ca
n't
imagin
anyon
with
a
reason
attent
span
be
more
than
momentarili
distract
by
thi
pointless
adventur
.

mayb
that
's
why
the
onli
on
laugh
at
the
screen
i
attend
were
still
in
