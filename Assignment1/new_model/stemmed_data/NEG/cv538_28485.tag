director

seem
to
be
revisit
hi
biggest
hit
,
1984
's
``
ghostbust
,
''
but
``
evolut
''
fall
miser
short
.

on
reason
is
readili
appar
.

``
ghostbust
''
had
three
realli
funni
gui
as
it
scientist
-lrb-
bill
murrai
,
dan
aykroyd
,
and
harold
rami
-rrb-
,
but
``
evolut
''
ha
on
realli
funni
gui
-lrb-
orlando
jone
-rrb-
who
can
adlib
and
milk
the
comic
potenti
of
line
that
prove
useless
in
anyon
els
's
hand
.

for
good
measur
,
``
ghostbust
''
had
the
comic
talent
of
rick
morani
;
``
evolut
''
offer
seann
william
scott
,
who
wa
much
funnier
in
``
american
pie
''
and
``
road
trip
''
than
he
is
here
.

scott
ha
on
amus
scene
where
he
sing
``
you
ar
so
beauti
to
me
''
to
a
dragon-like
alien
to
draw
it
into
a
trap
.

other
than
that
,
scott
seem
unabl
to
make
much
of
the
thin
materi
the
writer
gave
him
.

an
actor
in
search
of
a
fort
,
david
duchovni
look
for
hi
gritti
action
hero
side
in
``
plai
god
''
and
hi
romant
side
in
``
return
to
me
.
''

now
he
want
to
find
hi
wacki
comed
talent
;
what
we
all
find
is
that
he
doe
n't
have
ani
.

look
for
him
to
be
back
on
tv
in
five
year
or
so
.

anoth
sad
case
is
juliann
moor
,
who
need
to
be
more
select
about
the
offer
she
accept
.

she
's
a
talent
actress
with
an
impress
list
of
credit
and
award
nomin
,
so
why
is
she
try
to
do
slapstick
comedi
?

her
charact
ha
a
tendenc
to
trip
over
and
bump
into
thing
,
but
the
trait
come
off
as
a
pathet
plea
for
laugh
.

the
sole
save
grace
of
the
film
is
jone
.

he
's
at
the
center
of
the
movi
's
funniest
scene
--
where
an
alien
bug
invad
harri
's
bodi
and
ha
to
be
pull
out
through
hi
ass
.

jone
is
the
onli
cast
member
who
can
take
the
comed
ball
and
run
with
it
,
but
he
ca
n't
carri
the
whole
movi
by
himself
.

he
found
himself
in
a
similar
situat
in
``
the
replac
,
''
where
he
wa
also
the
onli
comic
talent
in
an
ensembl
cast
.

jone
will
eventu
find
the
project
that
will
make
him
a
major
comedi
star
,
but
thi
is
n't
it
.
