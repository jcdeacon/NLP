the

ha
been
prep
for
beatti

next
``
ishtar
.
''

so
,
is
it
that
bad
?

the
answer
is
no
.

but
it
's
not
veri
good
either
.

the
major
problem
with
``
town
and
countri
''
is
that
it
's
unstructur
and
random
.

stoddard
is
immedi
establish
as
a
philander
,
have
just
bed
a
flaki
cellist

overeact
,
but
send
porter
to
support
mona
on
a
trip
to
check
out
her
famili

the
two
childhood

end
up
in
bed
togeth
,
make
us
wonder
why
thei
'd
never
becom
a
coupl
to
begin
with
.

back
home
,
their
second
coupl
is
interrupt
by
elli
burst
in
to
tell
mona
she
think
porter
's
cheat
on
her
.

porter
goe
off
on
a

idaho
to
have
more
comic
misadventur
with
wacki
women
as
griffin
attempt
to
tell
him
that
he
's

.

the
four
friend
,
along
with
everi
woman
porter
's
dalli
with
,
all
end
up
back
in
new
york
citi
somewhat
happili
ever
after
.

although
the
film
begin
promisingli
,
resembl
a
woodi
allen
take
on
new

citi
wasp
,
too
mani
strand
drift
off
into

the
stoddard
household
is
huge
,
contain
two
adult
children

josh
hartnett
,
``
the
virgin
suicid
''
and
tricia

,
their
color
bedmat
and
a
maid
who
's
just
import
her
shirtless
boyfriend
from
the
rainforest
back
home
.

after
an
amus
earli
scene
that
ha
porter
overhear
three
bout
of
lovemak
while
in
search
of
a
nocturn
snack
,
the
six
support
player
ar
drop
except
for
an
out-of-nowher
appear
by
the
formerli
forgotten
son
.

porter
's
romant
misadventur
with
women
-lrb-
other
than
mona
-rrb-
ar
equal
mishandl
.

onc
the
marit
discord
begin
,
the
film
seem
as
if
it
wa
edit
with
a
machet
,
stop
and
start
,
never
regain
it
rhythm
.

while
beatti
get
off
a
few
tart
observ
,
hi
charact
is
mostli
passiv
and
bemus
.

mayb
we
're
suppos
to
feel
sympathi
for
an

while
shandl
's
releg
to
true

kinski
is
bland
and
unmotiv
.

andi
macdowel
take
a
weirdli
unapp
role
and
doe
what
she
can
with
the
screenplai
's
most
bizarr
subplot
,
which
find

a
halloween
parti
.

oscar
nomin
cinematograph
william
fraker
give
the
film
a
nice
look
,
but
director
chelsom
show
none
of
the
quirkili
and
blackli
humor
depth
he
brought
to
film
like
``
hear
my
song
''
and
``
funni
bone
.
''

the
script
is
thi
film
's
weakest
link-it
's
tell
that
most
of
the
-lrb-
few
-rrb-
laugh
come
from
old-fashion
physic
slapstick
and
the
sight
of
beatti
in
a
bear
suit
.

while
``
town
and
countri
''
is
n't
exactli
pain
to
sit
through
,
it
mostli
just
lai
there
.
