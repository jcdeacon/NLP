upon
first
view
of
thi
movi
,
the
phrase
``
been
there
''
and
``
done
that
''
come
quickli
to
mind
.

spy
hard
manag
to
steal
almost
everi
joke
from
the
zucker
brother
film
,
the
most
popular
of
which
ar
airplan
and
the
nake
gun
seri
.

steal
stuff
can
be
profit
in
thi
industri
,
but
onli
when
you
steal
the
right
stuff
.

what
littl
plot
there
is
involv
dick
steel
,
aka
.

agent
wd-40
-lrb-
lesli
nielsen
-rrb-
try
to
save
the
world
from
an
almost
derang
madman
plai
by
andi
griffith
.

along
the
wai
to
it
goal
-lrb-
goal
?
-rrb-

,
the
film
manag
to
spoof
mainli
the
jame
bond
type
film
,
but
also
manag
to
hit
on
film
such
as
home
alon
and
sister
act
.

the
trick
about
spoof
is
that
you
have
to
actual
be
funni
,
or
at
the
least
,
satir
.

spy
hard
achiev
neither
,
as
it
borrow
all
of
the
wrong
element
from
the
superior
zucker
brother
film
.

the
``
dick
,
the
world
is
in
danger
.
''

what
is
it
?

well
,
it
's
a
big
roundish
ball
float
in
space
around
the
sun
.
.

-lrb-
i
'm
paraphras
-rrb-
``
type
of
exchang
is
us
at
least
four
time
in
the
open
ten
minut
of
the
film
,
each
time
get
progress
less
funni
.
''

what
thei
should
have
stolen
were
the
background
sight
gag
which
were
so
effect
in
the
zucker
brother
's
film
while
write
their
own
dialogu
.

director
rick
friedberg
focus
more
on
the
mug
shot
of
hi
actor
-lrb-
especi
nielsen
,
who
can
do
thi
quit
well
-rrb-
than
on
the
deliveri
and
context
of
their
line
,
much
of
the
time
cut
the
punchlin
short
.

the
whole
film
seem
to
be
in
a
race
with
itself
to
be
over
,
as
is
evid
in
the
final
sequenc
,
where
there
is
no
comed
denouement
after
the
climax
.

as
wa
usual
in
the
zucker
brother
film
and
in
spy
hard
,
the
end
credit
tend
to
replac
thi
by
be
out
of
context
.

on
of
the
more
amus
wa
,
``
captain
of
the
enterpris
...
.

jame
t.
kirk
''
.

overal
,
i
thought
thi
wa
a
veri
weak
effort
.

while
all
of
the
right
film
to
spoof
were
chosen
,
thei
us
none
of
the
right
spoof
method
.

next
time
thei
should
``
spy
''
a
littl
bit
harder
.
