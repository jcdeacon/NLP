thi
is
a
promis

and
mr.

could
have
gone
ani

of
ambiti

thi
point

he
instead
choos
to
capitalis
upon

obviou
invers
of

charact
-lrb-
terri
is
a
repess

mourn

who
want

want
to
live
-rrb-
and
take
the
easi
rout
out
by
turn
dream
with
the
fish
into
a
typic
lark
where
the
two
charact
engag
in
a
seri
of
gener
dull
exploit
,
and
where
the
straight-lace
charact
learn
to
enjoi
and
ppreciat
life
when
hook
up
with
a
quirki
charact
.

thi
is
by-the-number
plot

buddi

redux

howev
,
dream
with
the
fish
is
most
hamper
not
by
it
uninspir
storylin
,
but
by
the
charact
which
carri
the
stori-it
help
in
such
a
film
to
have
at
least
on
of
the
protagonist
be
at
least
somewhat
empathet
,
if
not
likeabl
.

unfortun
,
that
is
not
the
case
here
,
where
both
of
the
film
's
lead
charact
ar
thorougli
uninterest
and
annoi
,
give
the
audienc
veri
littl
to
sympathis
with
their
respect
plight
,
and
even
less
reason
to
want
to
follow
their
onscreen
exploit
.

far
from
a
romp
,
thi
fatal
flaw
make
dream
with
fish
more
like
a
chore
to
endur
than
a
play
jaunt
,
and
undermin
the
attempt
at
emot
reson
in
the
latter
stage
of
the
film
as
the
two
men
begin
to
bond
.

mr.
taylor
's
dialogu
sporad
fall
flat
in
dream
with
the
fish-while
attempt
to
captur
a
quirki
and
clever
tone
,
it
too
often
come
across
instead
as
hopelessli
contriv
-lrb-
wit
such
line
as
``
you
should
have
ask
someth
more
interest
,
like
'
do
you
enjoi
the
pain
?
'

-
see

that

-rrb-

the
film
enjoi
a
few
inspir
moment-the
urn
scene
,
a
session
of
nude
bowl
,
the
policeman
join
in
on
terri
and
nick
's
acid
trip-but
unfortunatet
these
instanc
ar
few
and
far
between
,
and
for
the
most
part
the
humour
in
dream
with
the
fish
regist
more
as
attempt
rather
than
actual
success
.

thi
occur
particularli
often
dure
the
film
's
open
sequenc-as
terri
is
wrestl
the
bedridden
nick
for
hi
watch
in
the
hospit
,
i
'm
realis
that
thi
is
*
intend
*
to
be
funni
,
although
nari
a
smile
crept
upon
my
lip-which
is
probabl
due
to
the
obviou
fact
that
it
's
painfulli
clear
to
the
audienc
from
the
outset
that
terri
is
go
to
be
thwart
in
hi
initi
suicid
attempt
,
sap
ani
element
of
surpris
or
amus
from
nick
's
scheme
of

him
;
thi
is
not
a
film
which
ha
the
wherewith
to
kill
off
it
lead
star
in
the
open
ten
minut
.

the
entir
sequenc
is
,
then
,
clearli
an
exercis
for
charact
exposit
,
with
attempt
at
humour
terribl
diminish
by
utter
predict
.

among
the
cast
,
come
off
best
is
david
arquett
,
the
current
master
in
the
portray
of
meek
,
squirm
,
stammer
fresh-face
charact-he
would
have
been
terrif
as
the
lead
for
georg
huang
's
swim
with
shark-who
get
to
appli
hi
adept
for
timid
as
terri
.

mr.

ambiti
emploi
an
interest
visual
techniqu
,
where
the
portion
of
the
film
set
in
an
urban
environ
have
been
process
to
appear
extrem
graini
and
heavili
satur
,
as
oppos
to
a
bright
,
crisp
look
for
the
smalltown
scene
.

the
charg
of
dream
with
the
fish
's
protagonist
be
wholli
unempathet
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
on
come
from
me
;
i
seem
to
have
a
predilect
for
film
with
unlik
charact
,
and
inde
,
in
mani
case
have
i
been
in
the
minor
,
support
film
which
have
been
condemn
as
intermin
due
to
the
difficult
,
audienc-unfriendli
natur
of
their
charact
.

for
dream
with
the
fish
,
though
,
i
did
find
myself
on
the
flip
side
of
coin
,
often
hope
that
the
film
would
quickli
conclud
,
and
that
the
nick
charact
would
just
hurri
up
and
die
.
