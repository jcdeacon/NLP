comment

thi

is
bad
would
be
quit
an
understat

i
'm
not
sure
what
writer
and
director
ferland
wa
hope
to
accomplish
with
the
babysitt
.

suspens
?

famili
drama
?

humor
?

erotica

element
of
each
of
these
genr
exist
in
the
film
,
yet
it
fail
to
successfulli
achiev
ani
of
them
.

instead
,
the
babysitt
is
a
dull
,
lifeless
movi
which
manag
to
bore
and
ultim
irrit
it
viewer
.

i
suppos
thi
film
could
have
been
watchabl
if
it
were
n't
for
the
fact
that
the
charact
ar
univers
unapp
.

alicia
silverston
is

wast
plai
jennif
,
the
babysitt
.

her
charact
ha
absolut
no
depth
at
all
,
and
her
sole
purpos
in
the
movi
is
to
be
the
object
of
the
other
charact
'
fantasi
.

everyon
els
in
the
film
seem
to
be
in
a
competit
to
see
who
can
stoop
to
the
lowest
level
by
the
time
the
film
end
.

the
parent

fantas
about
the
babysitt

the
mother

about

's
best
friend
.

none
of
these
fantasi
sequenc
,
trust
me
,
ar
thing
that
need
to
be
seen
,
but
we
see
them
anywai
,
complet
with
cheesi

the

habit
of
smash
half-empti
beer
bottl
all
of
a
sudden
and
for
no

.

the
most
absurd
charact
,
howev
,
is
the
babysitt
's
boyfriend
who
seem
cataton
brain-dead
.

the
thug

to
sit

-rrb-

if
the
goal
of
the
babysitt
wa
to
be
suspens
,
then
it
fail
.

there
ar
surprisingli
few
tens
moment
in
thi
film
,
and
nearli
all
of
them
come
at
the
final
minut
.

by
that
time
,
howev
,
the
audienc
is
so
tire
of
the
inan
charact
that
no
on
truthfulli
care
what
happen
to
ani
of
them
.

no
suspens
occur
in
the
dream
sequenc
either
becaus
everi
singl
on
of
them
is
obvious
a
dream
sequenc
from

incept
.

if
the
goal
of
the
babysitt
wa
to
be
humor
,
then
it
also
fail
.

i
found
noth
even
remot
funni
about
the
booz
parent
who
seem
,
at
time
,
to
be
plai
for
laugh
.

if
the
goal
of
the
babysitt
wa
to
be
dramat
,
then
,
onc
again
,
it
fail
.

the
charact
ar
on-dimension
and
uninterest

final
,
if
the
goal
of

type
of
film
destin
to
be
plai
ad

on

,
then
it
fail
as
well
.

the
dream

ar
n't
erot
;
thei
ar
too
brief
and
,
outsid
of

i
ca
n't

the

10
minut
or
so
vagu
resembl

and
the
conclus
sport
a

the

at

end
of

movi
,
turn
to
her
