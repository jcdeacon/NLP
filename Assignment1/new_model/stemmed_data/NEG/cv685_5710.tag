that

there
ar
realli
not
enough
laughter-pack-moment
in
sgt.
bilko
to
fulli
entertain
the
averag
movi-goer
.

still
,
steve
martin
's
sgt.
bilko
is
plai
with
finess
and
full-forc
by
the
renown
comedian
.

without
him
,
sgt.
bilko
would
have
just
fell
flat
on
it
face
.

sgt.
bilko
did
moder
well
in
the
us
box
offic
earli
thi
year
but
i
doubt
it
will
earn
much
elsewher
around
the
world
.

the
current
trend
in
mix
success
in
such
tv-convers
mai
be
a
bless
in
disguis
,
realli
;
at
least
it
will
forc
hollywood
to
re-think
ani
of
it
initi
intent
to
turn
anoth
tv-idea
into
a
movi
or
at
the
veri
least
approach
those
idea
with
more
creativ
.

unless
you
ar
a
fan
of
the
tv-seri
or
love
to
watch
steve
martin
in
action
,
you
can
skip
thi
on
when
decid
which
movi
to
catch
in
the
local
theatr

i
'm
sure
there
ar
better
