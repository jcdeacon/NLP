us
to
be
synonym
for
the

he
could

of
cours
,
top
the
success
and
fame
of
big
action
name
like
sylvest
stallon
or
arnold
schwarzenegg
,
but
sheer
quantiti
of
hi
film
guarante
that
he
wa
household
name
among
shoot

up
and
beat
'em
up
genr

.

that

that
domin
the

in
previou
decad
by

with
cheap

and
,
more
often
than
not

.

the
hitman
,
1991
action
thriller
direct
by
chuck
's
brother
aaron
,
is
on
of
the
last
among
them
.

chuck
norri
here
plai
seattl
cop
betrai
,
shot
and
left
for
dead
by
hi
partner
-lrb-
which
should
n't
surpris
anyon
,
consid
the
fact
that
the
partner
is
be
plai
by
michael
park
,
specialis
for
role
of
usual

surviv
the

cop
is
pronounc

he

hitman
,
us
hi
abil
to
start
brutal
war
between
three
major
crime
organis-italian
,
french
canadian
and
iranian
.

sinc
it
is
rather
absurd
to
expect
great
act
abil
from
chuck
norri
,
at
least
not
in
thi
kind
of
movi
,
the
biggest
attract
of
thi
film
should
have
been
action
.

well
,
the
action
in
thi
film
fall
flat-it
is
bore
,
repetit
and
not
at
all
excit
.

it
is
noth
more
than
monoton
seri
of
scene
that
contain
violenc
too
brutal
even
for
thi
type
of
film
.

we
know
veri
littl
about
norri
'
charact
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
gangster
ar
portrai
with
more
human
dimens
.

in
the
end
we
almost
feel
sorri
for
them
,
sinc
thei
ar
shown
total
powerless
against
norri
and
hi
unstopp
and
bloodi
crusad
.

dure

that
problem
,
so
the

that

the
