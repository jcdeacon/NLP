what
's
to
like
about
a

chronicl
the

?

well
...
noth
.

so
,
why
make

hollywood
?

there
's
no
reason
why
the
averag
,
sane
movi-goer
will
be
interest
in
such
a
topic
.

no
on
is
go
to
enrich
their
life
or
have
a
good
time
by
watch
materi
such
as
thi
.

the
lack
of
qualiti
filmmak
in
``
8mm
''
-lrb-
from
technic
to
act
-rrb-
stand
out
even
more
when
you
consid
the
star
,
writer
,
and
support
cast
--
all
reput
.

but
joel
schumach
and
hi
brand
of
unlik

strike
again
!

like

but
thei
're

-rrb-

between

basic
,
thi
pictur
is
crap
and
no
on
should
pai
to

why
not
walk
out
?

well
,
thi
would
n't
be
a
thorough
review
about
a
thoroughli
bad
movi
.

here
's
why
you
should
spend
your
monei
on
dog
food
or
gum
instead
of
``

''
...
first
thing
--
if
you
do
n't
heed
my
advic
,
then
understand
what
you
're
about
to
see
befor
you
even
think
about
pai
good
monei
for
thi
crud
.

it
's
not
easi
to
watch
.

i
did
n't
know
the
detail
of
the
stori
beforehand
,
but
at

my
ignor
can
help

it
keep

who
in

for
a
gui
who
get
so
much

hi
track

is
unparallel

a
good
screenwrit
and
a
good
director
can
make
you
hypnot
watch
even
disgust
subject
matter
.

writer
andrew
kevin
walker
did
n't
recaptur
the
smart
of
the
fascin
script
he
author
for
'
95s
twist
thriller
,
``
se7en
''
.

director
schumach
doe
n't
have
that
innat
abil
to
make
you
watch
thing
you
do
n't
realli
want
to
see
like
better
director
ar
capabl
of
do
.

he
must
not
have
believ
hitchcock
who
espous
the
theori
that
what
we
do
n't
see
is
more
frighten
than
what
we
do
-lrb-
especi
when
it
's
a
scene
where
young
girl
is
suppos
to
be
murder
-rrb-
.

howev
,
gratuit
is
joel
's
middl
name
.

he
must
think
that
not
flaunt
a
hard-core
act
of
violent
sex
is
show
plenti
of
tact
restraint
.

no
,
he
doe
n't
go
that
far
,
but
we
see
enough
unpleas
.

he
doe
n't
leav
much
to
the
imagin
.

it
's
manipul
to
hurt
-lrb-
or
kill
-rrb-
young
girl
just
to
get
the
audienc
on
the
side
of
a

vigilant
.

the
script
and
act
should
be
what
get
us
to
believ
in

doe
joel
think
we
're

or
that
we
need
to
be
held
by
the
hand
to
comprehend
the
contrast
imageri

who
do
we
root
for
in
thi
mess
?

is
there
anybodi
out
there
?

it
's
not
all
the
director
's
fault
,
though
.

why
did
the
actor
sign
up
for
thi
?

nicola
cage
is
an
oscar-winner
,
for
cryin
'
out
loud
!

if
he
claim
to
do
film
to
challeng
himself
and
for
the
artist
merit
rather
than
the
monei
,
what
wa
he
smoke
when
thi
script
drop
on
hi
veranda
?

what
is
cage
suppos
to
be
in
thi
movi
--
a
whisper
batman
without
the
charisma
and
point
ear
?

villain
peter
stormar
is
five
step
past
hammi
.

and
what
is
jame
gandolfini
do
in
thi
trash
?

he
wa
so
solid
as
a
concern
father
in
``
a
civil

''
.

i
guess
ol'
nic
,
pete
,
and
jim
were
promis
a
mountain
of
monei
...
or
thei
're
sucker
.

or
thei
just
do
n't
care
.

there
ar
moment
-lrb-
albeit
brief
on
-rrb-
where
thi
rise
abov
the
wasteland
.

catherin
keener
is
good
-lrb-
although
too
quick
to
threaten
divorc
-rrb-
as
mr.
well
.

babi
cindi
is
obvious
cute
and
well
'
devout
love
of
hi

is
sweet
.

the
mother
-lrb-
ami
norton
-rrb-
of
the
girl
in
the
infam
8mm
film
is
not
too
bad
as
a
woman
deal
with
the
uncertain
loss
of
her
runawai
daughter
.

thi
film
ha
an
appropri
blue-tone
,
wash-out
look
like
``
payback
''
-lrb-
which
wa
a
much
better
movi
-rrb-
.

the
edit
is
okai
in
scene
of
no
dialogu
,
but
at
other
time
it
's
rough
.

dure
some
convers
,
close-up

ar
not

make
it
look
to
be
edit
by

n't
good
and
whose

wa
a

.

such
a

error
inde

speak

stand

,
do
n't
believ
the
mislead
trailer
.

there
's
not
much
action
here
.

occasion
,
ye
,
but
not
as
often
as
your
tv
will
have
you
believ
.

after
see
``
8mm
''
,
i
mai
not
be
interest
in
ever
watch
ani
kind
of
porn
again
.

is
that
a
posit
?

well
,
if
make
me
almost
ill
at
the
thought
of
glimps
a
dirti
movi
again
is
their
motiv
,
thei
've
done
a
swell
job
here
.

it
'll
be
a
long
time
befor
i
give
a
schumach
film
anoth
chanc
--
unless
i
lose
my
mind
and
becom
serious
deprav
.

but
todai
i
'm
not
deprav
,
so
i
ask
,
why
doe
thi
film
preach
that
thi
garbag
is
out
there
and
that
societi
should
be
worri
about
it
?

i
'm
sure
that
somewher
right
now
there
's
some
pretti
sick
crap
go
on
,
but
that
doe
n't
mean
i
need
to
know
about
it
.

ye
,
mr.
walker
,
your
script
tell
us
that
there
ar
some
screw-up
folk
out
there
.

ye
,
mr.
walker
,
the
proverbi
monster
doe
n't
look
like
we
expect
him
to
.

you
said
all
that
in
1995
.

move
on
.

thi
film
serv
no
purpos
.

it
doe
n't
entertain
,
it
doe
n't
teach
us
anyth
,
it
doe
n't
make
a
statement
beyond
the
obviou
``
thi
stuff
is
bad
''
approach
.

onli
if
thi
film
awaken
the
author
to
find
a
wai
to
abolish
these
type
of
horror
would
it
ever
do
somet
truli
worthwhil
.

that
's
not
like
to
happen
,
though
,
so
``
8mm
''
is
inde
a
scummi
wast
of
monei
.

orson
well
said
year
ago
in
a
tribut
to
film
,
``
to
movi
...
to
good
movi
''
.

if
onli
joel
schumach
and
the
produc
had
listen
and
told
andrew
kevin
walker
to
buri
thi
crud
deep
in
a
hole
.

like
``
snuff
''
film
,
``
8mm
''
should
never
have
been
made
.

now
,
excus
me
while
i
go
try
to
forget
i
ever
saw
it
.
