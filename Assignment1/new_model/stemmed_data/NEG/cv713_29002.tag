``
america

''
ha
an
intrigu
premis
and
a
great
cast
,

it
is
n't
nearli
as
edgi
or
funni
as
it
should
be
.

almost
all
the
problem
with
the
project
can
be
trace
back
to
co-script
writer
billi
crystal
,
who
show
the
same
lack
of
disciplin
with
the
screenplai
that
he
typic
displai
while
co-host

show
with

crystal
ignor
a
simpl
,
but
crucial
,
rule
:
for
a
screwbal
comedi
to
work
,
the
charact
must
be
place
into
a
rigid
social
set
,
becaus
onli
in
that
context
will
their
unorthodox
antic
be
humor
.

it

by

himself
as
the
publicist
,
billi
crystal
allow
himself
to
do
roughli
the

he
doe
on

come
to
think
of
it
,
``
littl

with
''
is
the
oper
phrase
for
thi
movi
.

as
a
hollywood
satir
,
``

is
toothless
.

as
a
romanc
,
it
is
at
best
a
minor
pleasur
.

such
a
good

,
such
a
wast
of

had
it
not

taken
long

,
a
better
