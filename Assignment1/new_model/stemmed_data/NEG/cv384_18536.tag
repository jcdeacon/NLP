support

ar
n't
call
support
for
noth
.

their
purpos
is
n't
just
to
move
the
plot
along
,
thei
're
also
suppos
to
give
the
storylin
a
backbon
.

to
do
thi
,
thei
must
exhibit
at
least
margin
depth
and
must
also
be
interest
.

rare
can
a
movi
work
if
it
put
an
interest
protagonist
in
the
middl
and
surround
her
with
hacknei
,
dull
,
cardboard
secondari
charact
,
especi
when
at
the
core
of
the
movi
is
the
protagonist
's
variou
interact
with
them
.

thi
is
the
love
letter
's
damn
error
.

capshaw
's
charact
is
as
good
as
i
have
seen
present
in
recent
romant
comedi
,
but
the
peopl
that
surround
her
ar
all
either
underwritten
or
pure
on-dimension
.

becaus
of
that
,
the
love
letter
is
awkward
and
insincer
.

even
wors
--
it
's
a
bore
.

i
like
capshaw
and
her
helen
,
but
everyon
els
is
painfulli
fake
,
undermin
the
littl
drama
or
sexual
tension
that
ha
the
potenti
to
exist
.

there
is
noth
particularli
hilari
about
all
thi
either
--
and
besid
degener
'
wisecrack
,
there
's
littl
that
is
even
a
littl
amus
.

thi
is
not
a
complet
thoughtless
film
and
director
peter
ho-sun
chan
doe
a
good
job
of
portrai
helen
's
yearn
and
variou
subtl
complex
.

but
it
's
far
from
profound
.

there
is
n't
a
common
theme
run
through
the
proceed
,
thu
the
movi
seem
thoughtfulli
pointless
.

realli
,
thi
is
a
harmless
littl
movi
;
it
's
far
from
an
abomin
and
it
's
not
tortur
to
sit
through
.

but
bad
,
it
is
.

aw
,
it
also
is
.

the
love
letter
is
a
failur
,
and
an
inan
failur
at
that
.
