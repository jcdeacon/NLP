ar
quick
to
forget
movi
like

yet
it
is
a
ridicul

els
line
up
two
armi
on

,
all
prepar

but
``

the

had
me
run
for
a
glass
of
water
everi
two
minut
;
would
the

after

appropri
to
cast
your

why

do

.
-rrb-

who
could
give

if
it
came
down
to
a
fight
for
leadership
between

,
why
did
n't
you
do
that
halfwai
through
