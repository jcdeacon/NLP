person
,
becaus
hi

the
victim
.

it
's
a
slobber
psychopath
,
of
cours
,
but
thi
time
there
's
a
twist
.

freeman
note
that
each
of
the
young
women
who
've
disappear
ar
all
strong
will
,
assert
,
and
more
success
in
their
career
than
the
averag
girl
.

we
soon
learn
that
the
gui

himself
casanova
,
whose
aim
is
to
``
domin
''
these
modern

,
mai
suggest
lamb
also
ha
a
fairli
predict
stori
.

perhap
,
but
that
film
also
ha
superbl
drawn
charact
and
smart
dialogu
.

so
let
not
insult
a
great
movi
by
take
the
comparison
ani
further
,
okai
?

and
as
for
comparison
to
seven
...
oh
pleas
!

kiss
the
girl
is
base
on
the
novel
by
jame
patterson
and
written
for
the
screen
by
on
david
klass
.

mayb
the
novel
wa
a
stinker
to
start
with
,
but
whatev
the
case
,
it
's
the
write
that
's
clearli
at
fault
here
.

on
,
these
charact
have
veri
littl
to
sai
that
's
engag
or
interest
.

two
,
the
script
ha
no
sens
of
humour
.

three
,
while
the
notion
of
a
psycho
's
victim
be
smart
,
success
women
is
an
interest
twist
,
the
execut
is
n't
even
half
as
good
as
the
idea
.

thu
,
ashli
judd
come
across
all
out
of
focu
,
instead
of
be
the
heart
of
the
stori
.

we
ca
n't
feel
her
rage
.

some
atroci
written
casual
exchang
between
her
and
sever
male
charact
ar
suppos
to
remind
us
that
she
's
the
no-bullshit
90
's
type
,
but
these
convers
bare
regist
.

and
as
for
freeman
,
kiss
the
girl
is
hi
second
dog
in
a
year
:
first
chain
reaction
,
now
thi
.

for
an
actor
of
hi
calibr
,
thi
is
most
worri
.

young
director
gari
fleder
score
a
hit
a
few
year
back
with
hi
quirki
pulp
fiction-esqu
thing
to
do
in
denver
when
your
dead
.

but
what
can
he
do
with
materi
as
resolut
mediocr
as
thi
?

not
much
,
and
you
can
hardli
blame
him
.

there
's
a
few
well-stage
chase
scene
through
the
forest
where
the
camera
whirl
,
dive
and
jump
,
and
the
effect
is
startl
.

but
the
script
is
beyond
rescu
.

what
hurt
most
is
that
hollywood
continu
to
get
awai
with
serv
up
thi
tripe
,
safe
in
the
knowledg
that
jade
audienc
will
lap
it
up
.

complac
rule
:
it
's
been
so
long
sinc
we
saw
a
mainstream
american
thriller
that
deliv
juici
charact
,
real
surpris
and
consist
sharp
dialogu
.

the
onli
consol
for
thi
viewer
is
that
my
ticket
to
the
movi
wa
a
freebi
,
posit
proof
that
the
best
thing
in
life
ar
n't
free
