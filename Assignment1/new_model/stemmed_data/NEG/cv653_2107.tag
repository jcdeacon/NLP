the

it
's
charmless
,
molass-slow
and
so
full
of
genuin
stupid
peopl
that
the
film
commiss

where
the

might
well
consid
some
sort

so
fast

furious
you

lead
the
list
is
the
jack
schmidt
charact
,
who
through
unexplain
but
presum
foul
main
is
alreadi
extrem
wealthi
when
our
stori
begin

there
is
no
reason
given
why
he
should
need

want
to
get

let
alon
why

it
would

but
instead

eh

then
there
's

an

and
pet

which
,
through
the
power
of
the
law
of
bad
cinema
,
must
inevit
confront
someon
who
ha
blunder
into
their
cage
.

howev
,
the
buffoon
prize
goe
to
the
atlanta
polic
,
who
come
off
like
the
keyston
kop
on
a
bad
dai
.

but
the
fun
doe
n't
end
there
in
the
shambl
of
a
script
by
william
davi
and
william
osborn
.

there
is
also
the
absenc
of
a
singl
,
solitari
interest
charact
.

karen
is
earnest
and
singl-mind
in
her
motherli
devot
,
but
lack
ani
kind
of
edg
which
would
make
her
a
convinc
crimin
,
and
basing
is
not
a
thespian
adept
at
flesh
out
flimsi
materi
.

schmidt
is
a
flaccid
villain
,
the
parol
offic
is
a
complet
blank
,
and
karen
's
son
and
ex-husband
might
as
well
be
furnitur
.

onli
kilmer
's
j.
t.
is
remot
appeal
,
but
hi
on
potenti
intrigu
qualiti
,
hi
ineptitud
,
is
never
develop
.

in
fact
,
kilmer
disappear
dure
the
middl
of
the
film
,
just
when
hi
admir
for
karen
could
have
made
for
an
interest
sub-plot
.

i
might
have
been
more
forgiv
if
the
pace
had
been
more
appropri
to
a
caper
comedi
,
but
the
real
mccoi
goe
nowher
fast
.

variou
scene
of
sneak
and
skulk
seem
to
take
forev
,
and
some
end
with
no
reason
evid
why
thei
did
n't
end
up
on
the
cut
room
floor
.

even
the
reason
clever
climact
break-in
fall
victim
to
thi
syndrom
,
includ
a
scene
of
on
of
the
thiev
drill
open
a
vault
which
last

there
is
no
tension
in
the
scene
,
just
tedium
.

russel

there
ar
so

with
