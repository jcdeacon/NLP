comment
:
virtual
seduct
,
execut
produc
by
roger
corman
and
lanc
h.
robbin
,
serv
as
a
cheapli-made
precursor
to
strang
dai
,
a
far
superior
film
.

both
movi
deal
with
desper
men
who
have
troubl
relat
to
their
current
lover
becaus
thei
ar
-lrb-
ab
-rrb-
us
technolog
to
be
with
former
lover
-lrb-
in
strang
dai
,
the
technolog
util
record
dream
rather
than
virtual
realiti
-rrb-
.

interestingli
,
both
film
also
take
place
a
coupl
of
year
from
now
dure
the
turn
of
the
new
millenium
,
though
strang
dai
us
the
set
far
more
effect
.

thi
exemplifi
the
problem
with
virtual
seduct
.

it
's
not
bad
for
what
it
is
:
low-budget
scienc
fiction
concern
the
psycholog
danger
of
virtual
realiti
.

unfortun
,
it
's
been
done
befor
and
sinc
in
much
better
film
,
a
fact
which
ultim
leav
the
sci-fi
fan
bore
by
thi
movi
.

virtual
seduct
ha
mani
fault
-lrb-
on
of
them
is
the
fact
that
the
video
inexplic
ha
it
own
trailer
befor
it
begin
-rrb-
.

the
film
's
script
explor
the
possibl
of
virtual
realiti
interestingli
at
first
,
but
it
treatment
of
the
subject
matter
get
heavi-hand
and
wooden
as
the
movi
progress
.

mani
import
scene
seem
too
dark
;
the
light
could
have
been
improv
significantli
.

the
cast
,
a
collect
of
veteran
b-movi
actor
and
sitcom
regular
,
do
onli
a
mediocr
job
in
their
role
.

jeff
fahei
,
of
the
origin
lawnmow
man
,
convincingli
,
though
unenerget
,
plai
the
lead
charact
.

carri
genzel
plai
pari
,
the
vr
lover
,
but
ami
dolenz
,
as
the
current
love
interest
,
seem
like
a
much
more
interest
and
attract
charact
with
a
care
person
,
which
doe
n't
lend
credenc
to
the
film
's
premis
.

meschach
taylor
,
of
the
onc
popular
design
women
sitcom
,
adequ
plai
a
scientist
work
on
the
project
,
but
hi
perform
is
n't
someth
to
write
home
about
either
.

virtual
seduct
is
on
of
those
harmless
movi
to
which
you
could
do
some
light
manual
labor
and
not
mind
have
it
on
in
the
background
.

in
other
word
,
on
could
fold
laundri
while
glanc
up
at
it
everi
now
and
then
,
but
it
's
rather
bore
to
just
sit
and
watch
.

the
movi
is
surprisingli
not
as
violent
as
on
expect
from
b-movi
in
thi
genr
,
but
it
is
still
an
adult
r-rate
film
due
to
sexual
situat
and
a
suicid
attempt
.

thi
turkei
,
ultim
,
is
n't
aw
,
but
it
's
not
particularli
interest
or
uniqu
either
.

do
n't
be
seduc
into
watch
thi
movi
unless
you
've
got
sever
load
of
laundri
and
noth
els
to
watch
.
