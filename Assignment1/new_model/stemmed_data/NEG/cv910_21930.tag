but

just
like

teen
direct

such
as
thi
on
,
the
foursom
decid
to
cover
up
the
death
to
make
it
look
like
a
murder
commit
by

and
also
just
like
in
other
teen
direct
movi
,
on
of
the
four
do
n't
agre
with
hide
it
,
thi
time
that
charact
be
juli
.

and
final
,
just
like
in
other
teen
movi
,
there
is
a
wit
outsid
the
group
try
to
hide
the
truth
.

thi
time
that
charact
be
fern
mayo
-lrb-
judi
greer
-rrb-
,
who
is
subject
to
mani
crack
from
courtnei
's
group
,
as
well
as
the
entir
school
.

>
from
here
,
jawbreak
turn
into
a
predict
tale
of
reveng
,
bad
moral
,
and
at
least
try
to
do
the
right
thing
.

not
onli
is
the
script
weak
,
on
a
whole
the
act
is
horrid
thank
to
a
larg
amount
of
the
main
cast
.

judi
greer
is
undeni
aw
as
her
on
dimension
,
annoi
charact
,
as
she
overact
everi
line
she
ha
.

also
on
the
bad
side
of
act
is
juli
benz
,
almost
fall
to
the
annoi
factor
that
greer
deliv
.

on
the
posit
side
of
act
,
rose
mcgowan
perform
well
here
,
but
doe
n't
match
her
wickedli
clever
perform
as
``
tatum
''
,
in
1996
's
scream
.

mcgowan
's
role
is
annoi
,
but
thi
onli
add
to
the
film
.

she
is
wickedli
mean
,
and
even
though
she
a
well-written
charact
,
you
downright
hate
her
.

fare
even
better
than
mcgowan
is
rebecca
gayheart
,
who
is
alwai
exception
believ
as
her
role
.

when
the
script
feed
her
a
on
or
two
dimension
charact
,
she
turn
it
into
three
,
alwai
put
strong
emot
and
power
into
her
role
.

gayheart
is
n't
given
as
much
to
do
here
as
she
wa
in
1998
's
urban
legend
,
but
you
can
still
get
a
strong
tast
of
her
act
skill
in
jawbreak
.

jawbreak
drift
and
miander
differ
sub
plot
throughout
,
hardli
throw
anyth
for
the
viewer
to
get
absorb
in
.

we
get
wai
off
of
the
topic
of
the
jawbreak
incid
,
and
get
into
thing
that
do
n't
have
anyth
to
do
with
the
actual
film
.

the
begin
and
end
ar
strong
,
it
's
just
the
middl
that
need
a
lot
of
help
.

dure
the
bodi
of
the
movi
,
it
is
undeni
repetit
,
never
progress
toward
a
conclus
.

noth
to
grab
the
viewer
's
interest
is
around
,
and
the
same
,
extrem
annoi
song
plai
over
and
over
again
.

jawbreak
tri
to
get
off
on
the
same
time
of
humor
us
in
the
1995
film
clueless
,
but
fall
flat
.

the
few
gag
that
actual
work
die
off
quickli
and
die
off
with
a
bang
.

all
in
all
,
a
horribl
disappoint
.

the
bottom
line
:
the
taglin
read
,
``
even
the
sweetest
candi
ar
sour
as
death
insid
.
''

ye
,
that
is
too
true
.

no
matter
how
good
thi
film
mai
have
look
,
it
fail
to
deliv
.
