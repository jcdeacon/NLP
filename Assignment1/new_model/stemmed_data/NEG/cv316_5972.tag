feel

a
film
that
made

though
i
had
trust
writer-director

bring
me
a
cool
glass

instead
he
threw

readi
to
let
sam
's

go
without

and
thu
begin
a

there
is
both
style
and
substanc
to
the
begin
of
feel

,
as
baigelman
open
with
an

montag

it
doe
a
great
job
of
set
up

a
life
which
ha
land
him
in

for
petti
crime
and
alwai
try

pleas
hi
famili
;
reev
'
wound
look
is
just
right
for
jjak
.

the
wed
sequenc
includ
a
number
of
nice
moment
,
most
notabl
the
aforement
bathroom
scene
in
which
a
simpl
question
is
given
a
veri
funni
spin
.

most
import
,
baigelman
begin
to
establish
the
connect
between
freddi
and
jjak
with
humor
and
economi
,
as
in
a
scene
where
thei
both
spontan
begin
sing
along
to
the
replac
'
``
i
will
dare
''
on
the
car
radio
.

you
would
have
everi
reason
to
expect
that
relationship
--
both
famili
and
romant
--
would
be
the
focal
point
of
feel
minnesota
.

unfortun
,
you
would
be
dead
wrong
.

i
suppos
i
should
have
expect
daisi
and
valentin
after
an
earli
scene
in
which
red
threaten
freddi
as
she
tri
to
avoid
the
wed
,
but
i
certainli
did
n't
expect
what
i
got
.

what
i
got
wa
yet
anoth
in
a
long
line
of
recent
film
try
to
ride
the
tarantino
wave
by
mix
gag
and
brutal
,
or
rather
creat
gag
about
brutal
.

suddenli
,
the
stori
of
romant
entangl
and
famili
conflict
becom
a
stori
about
a
corps
,
and
everyth
which
had
come
befor
degener
so
complet
that
virtual
noth
is
recogniz
.

the
sibl
rivalri
not
onli
becom
littl
more
than
an
excus
for
on
round
of
beat
after
anoth
,
but
there
is
no
consist
to
the
character
.

vincent
d'onofrio
turn
in
a
manic
perform
as
sam
,
whose
jealousi
,
competit
and
appar
sens
of
inferior
seem
far
more
in
keep
with
what
we
know
about
jjak
,
while
reev
turn
into
a
frame
hero
too
reminisc
of
chain
reaction
,
and
both
of
them
spend
most
of
the
second
half
of
the
film
scream
and
cover
in
blood
.

thei

i
do
n't
want
to
dismiss
baigelman
's
success
out
of

--
he
get
a
fun
perform
out
of
dan

some

and
it

it

is

that
