of
``
mr.
magoo
,
''
special
interest
group
repres
the
vision-impair
let
out
a
cry
of
dismai
.

mr.
magoo
,
thei
claim
,
would
be
an
insult
to
the
men
and
women
thei
repres
.

in
fact
,
thei
were
wrong
.

mr.
magoo
is
not
just
an
insult
to
the
blind
and
near-blind
,
it
's
an
insult
to
everi
human
be
who
ha
the
misfortun
to
suffer
through
thi
dreadfulli
unfunni
,
90
minut
atroc
.

it
's
state
the
obviou
to
remark
that
disnei
appear
to
have
run
out
of
origin
idea
.

look
at
their
roster
of
1996
and
1997
releas
,
and
you
'll
see
a
shock
list
of
retread
,
includ
101
dalmatian
,
georg
of
the
jungl
,
jungl2jungl
,
that
darn
cat
!

,
flubber
,
and
now
mr.
magoo
.

the
best
of
these
-lrb-
georg
of
the
jungl
-rrb-
wa
mildli
entertain
.

the
worst
,
mr.
magoo
,
expos
just
how
pain
a
bad
movi
experi
can
be
.

the
first
problem
with
mr.
magoo
is
the
script
.

despit
the
collabor
of
nake
gun
scribe
pat
proft
,
mr.
magoo
is
comic
barren
.

from
begin
to
end
,
there
's
not
a
laugh
to
be
found
.

everi
attempt
at
humor
--
and
there
ar
lot
of
them
--
fall
flat
with
an
audibl
thud
.

you
'd
think
that
out
of
the
dozen
of
gag
jam
into
thi
film
,
at
least
a
few
would
work
,
but
that
's
not
the
case
.

i
've
had
more
laugh
dure
ingmar
bergman
pictur
.

then
there
's
lesli
nielsen
,
who
look
,
sound
,
and
act
absolut
noth
like
the
anim
charact
-lrb-
memor
voic
by
jim
backu
-rrb-
.

in
the
past
,
nielsen
ha
proven
hi
comic
aptitud
with
role
in
movi
like
airplan
and
the
nake
gun
.

late
,
howev
,
he
ha
been
get
lazi
,
take
part
in
the
like
of
dracula
:
dead
and
love
it
,
spy
hard
,
and
mr.
magoo
.

even
if
nielsen
wa
in
top
form
,
it
would
take
an
incred
stretch
of
imagin
to
see
him
as
magoo
-lrb-
especi
sinc
we
're
remind
of
the
origin
by
the
short
cartoon
segment
that
open
and
close
the
film
-rrb-
,
but
``
top
form
''
is
not
a
phrase
i
would
us
to
describ
hi
perform
here
.

thi
is
strictli
a
take-the-monei-and-run
oper
.

the
stori
,
which
,
like
mani
disnei
stori
,
can
be
describ
in
on
long
sentenc
:
magoo
is
the
onli
wit
to
the
theft
of
a
rare
jewel
from
a
museum
,
and
,
as
he
is
try
to
apprehend
the
thiev
on
hi
own
,
the
polic
mistak
him
for
the
robber
.

the
cop
ar
plai
by
erni
hudson
and
stephen
tobolowski
,
who
take
their
lump
earli
and
often
.

the
bad
gui
ar
kelli
lynch
-lrb-
who
doe
a
lot
of
martial
art-type
kick
-rrb-
,
nick
chinlund
,
and
malcolm
mcdowel
-lrb-
who
ha
the
good
sens
to
look
embarrass
-rrb-
.

matt
keeslar
portrai
on
of
magoo
's
sidekick
--
hi
nephew
,
waldo
.

the
bumbl
man
's
other
,
more
interest
companion
is
a
dog
name
angu
.

most
of
mr.
magoo
's
humor
come
in
the
form
of
fail
slapstick
.

the
cartoon
violenc
level
in
thi
film
doe
n't
approach
that
of
home
alon
3
or
flubber
,
but
it
's
still
pretti
acut
,
with
charact
get
hit
on
the
head
with
sledgehamm
and
knock
off
snowi
precipic
.

there
's
a
non-violent
bit
with
magoo
prepar
a
chicken
dinner
that
could
have
been
funni
if
it
wa
handl
better
,
but
,
compar
to
mr.
bean
's
recent
,
similar
misadventur
,
it
doe
n't
hold
up
well
.

then
there
is
the
seri
of
lame
joke
that
result
from
magoo
's
near
blind
,
such
as
the
occas
when
he
mistak
a
wild
anim
for
a
babi
.

i
'm
will
to
cut
director
stanlei
tong
a
littl
slack
.

tong
,
a
hong
kong
film
maker
try
to
break
into
the
hollywood
market
,
ha
helm
sever
jacki
chan
movi
,
includ
first
strike
,
rumbl
in
the
bronx
,
and
supercop
.

hi
chief
talent
,
that
of
choreograph
martial
art
fight
,
is
wast
here
-lrb-
despit
some
high
kick
by
kelli
lynch
-rrb-
.

like
john
woo
-lrb-
hard
target
-rrb-
and
ringo
lam
-lrb-
maximum
risk
-rrb-
befor
him
,
it
appear
that
tong
ha
been
consign
to
the
purgatori
of
make
a
bad
movi
as
hi
entri
into
the
american
mainstream
.

it
is
worth
note
that
,
unlik
mani
disnei
film
which
hold
a
pervers
appeal
for
the
under-10
crowd
while
drive
parent
to
distract
,
mr.
magoo
appear
to
bore
viewer
of
all
ag
.

the
screen
i
attend
wa
wall-to-wall
kid
,
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
thei
did
n't
seem
to
be
enjoi
themselv
.

when
the
film
wa
over
,
i
ask
on
littl
girl
what
she
thought
of
it
.

her
pain
express
confirm
the
adag
that
a
pictur
can
inde
be
worth
a
thousand
word
.

mr.
magoo
is
the
kind
of
movi
that
should
be
reject
by
ani
potenti
viewer
,
sight
unseen
.
