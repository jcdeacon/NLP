it
's
a
sad
state
of
affair
when
the
back
box
blurb
is
more
excit
than
the
movi
contain
within
it
.

such
is
the
case
for
the
1990
paul
mayersberg
film
_
the
last
samurai
_
.

though
the
blurb
allud
to
``
a
jungl
fill
with
polit
intrigu
,
uneasi
allianc
,
and
murder
enemi
at
everi
turn
,
''
the
stori
of
the
movi
is
actual
quit
simpl
-lrb-
and
prosaic
-rrb-
:
a
middl-ag
japanes
businessman
name
endo
-lrb-
plai
by
john
fujioka
-rrb-
and
hi
assist
,
both
of
whom
have
samurai
aspir
,
travel
to
africa
in
search
of
hi
ancestor
,
who
went
to
bring
buddhism
to
africa
.

he
hire
the
servic
of
down-at-the-heel
vietnam
veteran
pilot
johnni
congo
-lrb-
the
redoubt
lanc
henriksen
-rrb-
and
hi
girlfriend
-lrb-
arabella
holzbog
-rrb-
,
and
travel
to
the
camp
of
an
arm-merchant-cum-safari-host-cum-islam-missionari
-lrb-
john
saxon
-rrb-
and
hi
wife
-lrb-
lisa
eilbach
-rrb-
.

thei
ar
all
kidnap
by
an
african
revolutionari
guerilla
with
witch-doctor
aspir
to
conceal
a
pre-arrang
arm
deal
,
which
subsequ
fall
through
.

congo
escap
,
find
endo
's
ancestor
's
sword
,
and
come
back
,
gun
blaze
,
to
free
the
rest
of
them
,
and
endo
kill
the
revolutionari
with
the
sword
.

the
end
.

_
the
last
samurai
_
is
on
of
those
movi
that
is
neither
bad
enough
nor
good
enough
to
be
enjoy
.

it
is
mere
_
there
_
.

the
murki
plot
is
fill
with
subtext
that
ar
never
elabor
,
subplot
that
ar
never
explain
,
and
mani
scene
that
make
veri
littl
sens
at
all
.

the
film
is
shot
through
with
all
the
tire
old
``
inscrut
japanes
samurai
''
and
zen
stereotyp
that
ar
to
be
expect
from
an
american
movi
.

it
is
quit
slow-pace
,
with
onli
a
bit
of
action
near
the
end
,
and
the
final
duel
between
endo
and
the
terrorist
is
quit
anticlimact
.

most
of
the
act
is
fair
,
with
the
possibl
except
of
congo
's
girlfriend
.

lanc
henriksen
is
hi
usual
scene-chew
self
,
and
is
on
of
few
possibl
reason
anyon
might
conceiv
have
for
see
thi
movi
.

the
onli
other
bright
spot
is
the
sweep
african
sceneri
.

i
paid
$
3
for
thi
film
,
from
the
discount
rack
at
best
bui
,
and
halfwai
suspect
i
overpaid
for
it
.

if
you
ar
in
the
mood
for
samurai
,
read
a
clavel
novel
or
watch
a
kurusawa
movi
.

skip
_
the
last
samurai
_
unless
you
ar
a
die-hard
henriksen
fan
.
