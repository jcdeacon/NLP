but
who

right
?
-rrb-

when
rubin
wa
onli
ten
.

he
is
to
serv
three
life
sentenc
with
no
possibl
of

to
the

''

hmmm
.

after
a
few
visit
to
the
prison
,
thei
becom
convinc
of
rubin
's
innoc
and
launch
their
own
full-scale
investig
even
though
two
juri
have
convict
him
.

thei
meticul
go
through
all
the
file
and
revisit
all
the
old
wit
-lrb-
i
wonder
if
ani
of
them
might
be
cranki
old
women
who
slam
the
door
in
their
face
?
-rrb-

and
in
the
cours
of
their
relentlessi
tediou
sleuth
uncov
obviou
evid
confirm
the
hurrican
's
innoc
that
wa
either
ignor
or
never
seek
out
dure
the
first
two
proceed
.

of
cours
,
we
're
alreadi
told
that
he
's
innoc
.

a
movi
like
thi
is
especi
frustrat
becaus
we
're
not
be
shown
everyth
signific
that
happen
to
carter
dure
thi
period
in
hi
life
.

all
too
obvious
,
we
're
get
the
hollywood
water-down
version
.

that
would
be
ok
except
that
the
part
we
ar
get
is
milk
for
everi
singl
drop
of
melodrama
that
the
filmmak
could
possibl
squeez
out
of
it
.

it
's
almost
cruel
.

the
melodrama
is
n't
of
the
entertain
kind
either
;
it
's
the
hokei
,
ram-down-your-throat
varieti
where
everi
emot
is
exagger
to
the
point
of
absurd
.

wit
the
villain
feroci
grind
hi
teeth
at
the
final
trial
or
the
constant
pseudo-saintli
of
our
four
protagonist
.

the
hurrican
is
your
basic
courtroom
movi
except
it
's
a
no-frill
courtroom
movi
.

it
's
formula
strip
to
the
bare
necess
.

you
have
your
wrongli
accus
black
man
.

you
have
your
melodramat
final
courtroom
scene
.

but
there
's
noth
els
.

you
'd
expect
some
sort
of
involv
investig
.

but
that
's
not
necessari
sinc
we
're
implicitli
inform
of
hi
innoc
.

thu
the
whole
middl
portion
of
the
movi
is
reduc
to
the
protagonist
brood
.

brood
to
himself
.

brood
to
other
inmat
.

brood
to
lesra
.

brood
to
lesra
's
canadian
friend
.

brood
in
letter
.

i
do
n't
think
i
'll
ever
look
at
brood
the
same
wai
again
.

it
wa
n't
long
befor
i
got
tire
of
hear
the
hurrican
's
exceedingli
deep
medit
on
hi
condit
.

i
want
someth
to
happen
.

as
for
washington
's
perform
in
the
titl
role
--
i
figur
i
'd
have
to
address
it
sooner
or
later
consid
the
amount
of
attent
it
's
receiv
--
he
is
top
notch
,
though
still
bore
.

how
is
that
possibl
?

well
,
he
doe
what
jewison
want
him
to
do
perfectli
.

unfortun
what
jewison
ask
him
to
do
is
a
load
of
crap
.

what
a
wast
of
a
great
perform
.

speak
of
wast
,
why
the
hell
did
john
hannah
agre
to
do
thi
?

he
's
an
extrem
talent
actor
and
i
love
him
dearli
,
but
what
is
he
do
here
?

to
call
hi
charact
-lrb-
along
with
schreiber
's
and
unger
's
-rrb-
a
stick
figur
would
be
a
gross
understat
.

all
three
of
them
come
off
as
verit
mother
theresa
,
as
benevol
as
do-gooder
come
.

if
thei
're
to
plai
a
major
part
in
thi
movi
,
why
not
make
them
real
peopl
,
with
real
feel
and
emot
?

look
:
if
you
're
go
to
make
a
formula
movi
,
do
n't
undermin
the
formula
.

courtroom
drama
can
be
fun
,
but
thi
is
ridicul
.

not
onli
is
it
trite
,
it
's
bore
.
