,
with

that

worst
of

is
a

the

behind

too
long
,
leav
a
lot

you
ca
n't
blame
murphi
for
be
unabl
to
muster
ani
enthusiasm
for
the
scene
with
hi
bland
lead
ladi
,
but
he
should
have
known
better
than
to
take
thi
role
at
all
.

scott
roper
exist
in
an
uncomfort
middl
ground
between
the
kind
of
street-wise
fast-talker
murphi
ha
built
a
career
on
and
an
actual
three-dimension
charact
,
and
murphi
is
never
abl
to
reconcil
the
two
.

the
script
seem
to
have
been
doctor
for
him
,
with
a
gambl
problem
turn
into
a
bit
of
charact
color
and
hi
suppos
inabl
to
form
relationship
turn
into
a
caus
for
gag
rather
than
actual
conflict
,
yet
there
is
still
too
littl
comedi
for
murphi
to
work
with
.

for
much
of
the
film
,
he
walk
around
with
an
intens
frown
,
and
it
is
overminut
into
metro
befor
you
hear
that
trademark
laugh
for
the
first
time
.

murphi
is
strand
with
too
few
solid
punch
line
,
and
nearli
all
of
the
on
he
doe
have
bounc
of
ejogo
and
fall
to
the
ground
limpli
.

i
suppos
i
should
give
director
thoma
carter
credit
for
take
the
obligatori
san
francisco
car
chase
-lrb-
how
much
do
you
want
to
bet
on
the
likelihood
of
see
a
car
soar
over
a
hill
?
-rrb-

and
do
a
few
interest
thing
with
it
.

as
vehicl
ar
sent
fly
and
passeng
sent
sprawl
by
a
runawai
cabl
car
,
it
is
possibl
at
least
for
a
moment
to
take
some
pleasur
in
a
goofi
spin
on
a
familiar
situat
.

carter
doe
an
even
better
job
by
take
that
old
suspens
stand-by
--
the
medicin
cabinet
mirror
which
will
close
to
reveal
a
killer
stand
behind
someon
--
and
us
it
to
defus
tension
not
onc
,
but
_
twice
_
.

the
fact
that
carter
wa
abl
to
demonstr
even
that
much
recognit
of
clich
,
and
a
willing
to
subvert
them
,
make
hi
involv
in
the
rest
of
the
disast
that
is
metro
all
the
more
puzzl
.

an
action
film
like
thi
plod
so
relentlessli
and
obvious
from
point
a
to
point
b
to
point
c
that
you
might
find
yourself
shout
out
``
point

''

while
thei
're
still
get
to
point
b
,
or
get
up
with
the
rest
of
the
audienc
after
the
big
explos
which
signal
that
noth

happen
