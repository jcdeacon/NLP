the
ey
stai
just
out

peculiar
.

how
bad
is
thi
movi
?

i
refer
you
to
my
`
review
quot
sourc
'
litmu
test
.

just
take
a
look
at
the
full-page
ad
in
the
newspap
and
see
where
thei
ar
pull
quot
.

for
thi
movi
,
thei
ar
from
magazin
call
`
flaunt
'
and
`
mirabella
.
'

no
doubt
,
thei
were
impress
with
judd
's
seri
of
catwalk
and
disguis
chang
.

the
major
problem
with
`
ey
of
the
behold
'
is
that
the
film
jerk
forward
,
alwai
unsur
of
it
ultim
destin
.

if
it
wa
a
thriller
,
there
wa
littl
to
keep
us
entranc
.

if
it
wa
a
love
stori
,
there
wa
absolut
no
emot
pull
.

complet
disjoint
in
structur
,
it
's
onli
save
grace
wa
it
stylish
look
which
remind
me
of
my
favorit
car
commerci
-lrb-
the
on
where
the
`
6
'
on
the
tachomet
dissolv
into
a
wind
road
and
a
passeng
rail
car
dissolv
into
a
small
miniatur
on
a
child
's
train
set
-rrb-
.

i
am
also
still
hope
that
ashlei
judd
will
find
a
seriou
role
to
showcas
her
potenti
talent
.

beyond
that
,
the
film
is
hopelessli
out-of-control
and
is
in
need
of
serious
better
traction
and
handl
.
