,
the
latest
attempt
to
bring

legendari
hero
to

,
is
on
of
the
most
inept
and
ill-time

tarzan
and
the

appear
head
for
a
quick
trip
to

store

i
have
no
idea
why
the
produc
chose
now
to
bring
back
tarzan
;
it
's
not
as
if
there
ar
legion
of
new
fan
clamor
for
hi
next
movi
.

furthermor
,
it
's
even
more
curiou
that
thi
film
is
rate
pg
,
which
,
by
definit
,
rule
out

and
,
while
i

not
advoc
the
excess

of

,
tarzan

a
slightli
more
adult
approach
than
the
on

of

,
no
tweak
of
the

to
chang
the

could
have

humor
,
and
you
have
a
fair
idea
of
what
thi
tarzan
is
like
.

with

anyon

much
better

the
onli
worthwhil
element
of

the

the

that
it

been
done
often
enough

the

line
is
pure
formula
,
which
ha
larg
been
true
throughout
the
year
for
almost
all
of

the
problem
is
that

over

and
