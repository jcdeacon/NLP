the

have
alwai
been
littl
more
than

the

so
much
of

that
you
almost
want

the

-rrb-
,
``
get

most
of
the
film
is
devot
to
show
the
brother
'
effort
to
hide
the
other
's
exist
from
their
own
acquaint

why
it
is

seem
not

that
thei

not

which

the

in

,
even

seem

even
chan
's

humor
is
off-kilter

some

a
case
in

:
whenev
anyon
see
the
brother
togeth
,
thei
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
dead
faint
.

ar
we
laugh
yet
?

as
usual
,
the
final
showdown
is
the
film
's
jewel
,
a
tour
de
forc
displai
of
chan
'
s
agil
and
grace
.

never

that
it
's
not

it
's
all
good
fun
,
but
too
littl
too

perhap
chan
's
next
movi
should
just
be
a
collect
of
the
last

sequenc
of
all
of

.

thei
could
call
it
jacki
