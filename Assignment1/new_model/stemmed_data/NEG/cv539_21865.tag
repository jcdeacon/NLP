wai
.

``
end
of
dai
''
begin
with
the
birth
of
a
babi
girl
in
1979
who
inexor
,
due
to
the
format
of
the
star
on
that
night
,
will
be
the
carrier
of
satan
's
babi
the
hour
befor
new
year
's
of
2000
.

fortun
for
the
movi
's
sake
,
the
girl
grow
up
and
now
resid
in
manhattan
with
skyscrap
,
subwai
train
in
dark
tunnel
,
and
a
myriad
of
inept
nypd
offic
.

it
's
an
action
film
's
dream
come
true
when
the
director
is
given
ton
of
cool
stuff
to
blow
up
.

imagin
if
the
girl
had
live
in
anytown
,
usa
,
where
the
onli
thing
to
destroi
is
a
dairi
queen
and
a
post
offic
.

arnold
schwarzenegg
-lrb-
jericho
cane
-rrb-
,
in
a
seri
of
bore
event
find
himself
in
the
middl
of
a
religi
battl
between
the
church
,
who
is
try
to
hide
the
girl
-lrb-
or
in
some
case
try
to
kill
her
-rrb-
,
and
satan
-lrb-
gabriel
byrn
-rrb-
who
is
try
to
make
her
pregnant
.

if
the
devil
is
success
,
the
world
will
no
longer
exist
as
we
know
it
.

jericho
feel
it
is
hi
duti
to
protect
the
girl
from
everyon
becaus
1
-rrb-
he
onc
had
faith
but
no
longer
doe
and
2
-rrb-
hi
wife
and
daughter
were
kill
and
he
feel
respons
for
it
.

jericho
cane
is
your
clich
,
by-the-number
hero
right
up
to
hi
name
.

arnold
fittingli
plai
the
charact
as
clich
as
he
can
.

he
shout
at
everyon
,
from
cop
to
priest
,
to
the
devil
.

in
on
truli
hilari
scene
,
which
wa
suppos
to
be
the
ultim
dramat
high
point
,
jericho
scream
to
the
devil
;
``
you
ar
a
@
#
$
%
!

&
choir
boi
!
''

you
ar
a
choir
boi
!
''
''

those
two
line
mark
the
high
point
of
thi
film
.

a
movi
can
still
be
enjoy
when
the
support
cast
is
more
effect
than
the
main
actor
.

``
end
of
dai
''
fail
to
contain
ani
memor
perform
with
the
except
of
gabriel
byrn
.

byrn
,
plai
a
man
who
ha
been
made
the
manifest
of
the
devil
,
seem
to
be
the
onli
on
who
is
have
fun
in
thi
whole
movi
.

he
wonderfulli
plai
a
manipul
villain
with
the
power
to
control
everyon
at
ani
time
.

the
annoi
thing
about
hi
charact
,
howev
,
is
that
he
ha
the
power
to
kill
ani
human
with
a
simpl
punch
in
the
face
,
yet
he
find
it
imposs
to
serious
hurt
jericho
.

i
can
not
count
the
number
of
time
he
could
have
kill
jericho
and
taken
the
girl
from
hi
custodi
.

the
other
actor
in
the
film
give
veri
weak
and
unconvinc
perform
.

kevin
pollak
,
who
plai
the
partner
and
close
friend
of
jericho
,
is
the
supposedli
funni
charact
in
the
film
-lrb-
everi
action
movi
ha
on
-rrb-
.

the
on
problem
is
that
pollak
doe
not
deliv
on
funni
line
.

robin
tunnei
plai
the
chosen
mother
of
satan
's
babi
with
extrem
annoy
.

she
get
no
sympathi
from
ani
of
the
charact
in
the
film
,
except
arnold
who
pretend
she
is
hi
wife
and
daughter
,
or
ani
of
the
viewer
in
the
audienc
.

in
on
unnecessari
scene
,
tunnei
walk
out
of
her
room
and
take
her
top
off
.

is
thi
her
job
in
the
film
?

the
actor
ar
not
to
blame
entir
becaus
the
script
is
terribl
.

you
can
tell
a
script
is
terribl
when
you
ar
abl
to
predict
what
will
happen
minut
befor
it
doe
.

thi
littl
predict
game
is
a
veri
fun
except
to
try
to
sit
through
thi
nonsens
of
a
movi
.

in
a
last
attempt
to
make
thi
movi
good
,
special
effect
ar
us
to
try
to
entertain
the
audienc
.

but
without
a
memor
action
scene
in
the
whole
film
,
the
director
ha
not
done
hi
job
successfulli
.

thi
film
would
have
gotten
a
c
+
if
arnold
stood
in
front
of
a
camera
and
shout
``
you
ar
a

@@
choir
boi

''

for
two
hour
.
