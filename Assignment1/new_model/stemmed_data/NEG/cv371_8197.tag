men

ha
defi
the
odd
.

when
i
first
saw
that
the
flick
wa
89
minut
long
,
i
thought
mayb
that
thi
wa
a
poor
attempt
at
an
independ
dai
type
film
that
just
ran
out
of
ga
.

howev
,
i
now
realiz
that
not
onli
did
men
in
black
run
out
of
ga
,
but
the
film
in
90
minut
manag
to
show
off
a
veri
origin
idea
-lrb-
which
summer
audienc
have
embrac
-rrb-
that
becom
old
aboutminut
into
the
movi
.

tommi
lee
jone
and
will
smith
plai
two
``
govern
''
agent
who
ar
respons
for
keep
order
in
alien
societi
.

the
ridicul
plot
begin
when
an
alien
``
bug
''
,
plai
weirdli
by
vincent
d'onofrio
,
who
wa
so
great
in
full
metal
jacket
,
land
on
earth
to
retriev
a
galaxi
that
's
somewher
on
``
orion
's
belt
.
''

anywai
,
the
basic
plot
revolv
around
jone
and
smith
to
stop
thi
bug
from
get
the
galaxi
,
or
a
higher
power
will
blow
up
the
earth
.

the
premis
is
ridul
,
but
that
is
not
why
i
did
n't
like
thi
film
.

i
love
origin
plot
.

thi
on
had
an
origin
on
.

but
director
barri
sonnenfeld
did
someth
to
thi
film
that
ruin
it
plot
:
he
made
the
film
drag
and
also
put
in
unncessari
element
in
it
that
ar
found
in
romanc
film
.

whenev
i
saw
d'onofrio
's
bug
stomp
and
eat
peopl
in
the
film
,
it
got
terribl
bore
after
a
while
.

while
smith
's
wise-crack
did
fill
in
the
gap
,
it
wa
n't
enough
.

and
also
,
i
can
not
believ
the
screenwrit
elect
to
have
a
sub-plot
where
tommi
lee
jone
miss
hi
former
lover
becaus
as
an
alien
agent
,
thei
ca
n't
have
contact
with
ani
human
realli
.

and
here
i
see
jone
,
at
a
satellit
comput
,
watch
hi
lover
plant
the
garden
?

a
sentiment
moment
in
an
alien
movi
?

nice
try
,
but
i
do
n't
think
so
.

it
doe
n't
work
here
.

it
just
make
the
movi
even
more
ridicul
and
even
more
bore
:
we
do
n't
onli
have
alien
to
worri
about
,
but
now
we
have
jone
's
conscienc
.

i
came
into
the
movi
not
want
to
see
jone
's
conscienc
,
but
want
to
see
a
real
action
movi
that
had
lot
of
alien
in
it
.

mayb
it
's
unfair
that
i
partli
judg
thi
movi
on
what
my
expect
were
.

nevertheless
,
even
though
some
part
ar
inde
funni
,
the
plot
in
thi
movi
grew
old
and
bore
--
quick
.
