all
these
peopl
to
try
and
stop

befor
thei
cheat
their
wai
back
to
heaven
lead
to
a
violent
and
bloodi
end
that
will
make
you
think
twice
about
your
faith
.

what
a
movi
,
it
is
everyth
roll
into
on
:
an
offens
,
offbeat
,
smart
and
sassi
comedi
that
surprisingli
ha
a
great
messag
at
the
end
,
and
end
up
be
a
feel-good
movi
.

who
would
have
known
kevin
had
such
a
soft
side
on
him
that
could
make
us
know
that
he
is
a
faith
person
himself
.

now
for
those
of
you
who
get
offend
with
thi
movi
realli
should
not
take
it
to
heart
.

ye
it
mai
target
the
cathol
commun
and
bash
them
a
lot
,
but
it
also
seem
to
rather
than
go
against
god
and
heaven
,
it
actual
goe
with
god
and
kevin
give
a
messag
that
there
is
a
god
.

thi
review
mai
sound
confus
at
first
but
realli
the
onli
wai
to
understand
it
is
to
see
thi
excel
movi
.

kevin
goe
to
new
length
in
thi
hilari
comedi
and
give
us
some
great
charact
with
not
too
much
background
or
studi
and
rather
we
start
to
know
the
charact
as
we
watch
the
movi
.

of
cours
the
best
-lrb-
and
funniest
-rrb-
of
them
all
is
the
onli
duo
in
histori
that
have
made
me
fall
out
of
my
chair
laugh
and
that
my
friend
ar
jai
and
silent
bob
.

probabl
the
best
charact
in
movi
that
i
like
.

the
star-stud
cast
is
amaz
and
ha
some
other
cameo
by
georg
carlin
,
jeann
garafolo
and
so
mai
more
that
we
start
to
lose
track
after
a
while
.

the
script
wa
written
by
kevin
smith
with
mani
f
`
word
in
there
of
cours
and
a
strong
emphasi
on
sexual
talk
but
he
also
seem
to
concentr
on
what
is
import
rather
that
what
is
n't
and
make
us
laugh
at
the
same
time
as
we
think
.

chri
rock
give
a
hilari
perform
and
get
into
hi
charact
veri
well
,
with
some
classic
line
.

linda
fiorentino
is
just
perfect
for
her
role
and
make
us
believ
that
she
realli
is
who
she
is
.

of
cours
jason
mew
and
kevin
smith
do
a
great
job
as
jai
and
silent
bob
with
some
priceless
line
from
jai
-lrb-
as
well
as
silent
bob
-rrb-
.

alan
rickman
,
jason
lee
,
salma
hayek
round
out
the
cast
with
matt
damon
and
ben
affleck
in
the
star
role
.

be
oscar
winner
for
the
classic
`
good
will
hunt
'
thei
give
great
perform
here
again
but
matt
damon
seem
just
a
littl
held
back
and
to
me
did
not
give
it
all
he
could
.

ben
howev
wa
all
out
and
got
veri
much
into
hi
charact
as
well
as
the
stori
.

the
movi
's
onli
big
flaw
is
that
it
ha
a
few
unfunni
line
and
some
slow
part
to
go
along
with
it
.

howev
the
direct
by
kevin
and
the
script
by
kevin
as
well
as
the
priceless
perform
by
mani
of
the
cast
member
,
`
dogma
'
stand
as
a
new
classic
and
i
think
i
can
safe
compar
it
to
`
clerk
'
.

while
be
funni
at
time
,
in
the
end
it
becom
a
seriou
movi
with
an
import
messag
that
some
mai
not
agre
with
but
ca
n't
deni
it
.

`
dogma
'
will
offend
peopl
,
especi
deepli
religi
peopl
,
but
for
those
of
you
who
ar
open
mind
and
want
to
see
some
veri
funni
materi
then
thi
is
the
movi
for
you
.

all
kevin
smith
fan
must
see
!!
