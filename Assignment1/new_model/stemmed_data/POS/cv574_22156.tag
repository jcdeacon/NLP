laugh
so
hard
that
my
stomach
wa
kill

even
though
i
thought
``

''
and
``
be
john
malkovich
''
were
the
funniest
of
the
year
``
deuc
bigalow
''
follow
right
behind
them
.

the
direct
by
mike
mitchel
is
fantast
and
show
he
took
time
on
the
film
.

rob
schneider
give
a
surprisingli
endear
perform
and
when
hi
romanc
develop
with
on
of
hi
custom
kate
-lrb-
arija
bareiki
-rrb-
it
is
a
sweet
romanc
that
we
get
involv

and
actual
like
be
involv
in
it
.

``
deuc
bigalow
''
is
a
good-natur
film
worth
all
the
merit
it
can
get
.

it
not
a
classic
or
a
masterpiec
,
it
's
just
a
comedi
that
we
do
n't
feel
bad
about
watch
.

sure
it
mai
come
off
as
offens
and
mai
come
off
as
dumb
sometim
,
but
you
can
not
deni
that
it
is
n't
funni
.

``
deuc
bigalow
:
male
gigolo
''
is
no
disappoint
.

it
a
fast
pace
,
entertain
sweet
and
hilari
comedi
that
mai
be
destin
to
becom
a
cult
classic
.

fan
of
schneider
will
not
be
disappoint
and
fan
of
crude
but
nice
comedi
will
not
either
.

for
some
reason
the
film
garner
an
r
rate
but
with
no
``
f
word
''
or
extens
us
of
sexual
content
or
explicit
nuditi
i
wa
realli
wonder
why
the
film
wa
r
.

a
mild
r
to
put
it
to
the
least
,
but
even
if
your
under
17
or
abov
at
least
13
thi
film
is
good
enough
for
you
to
see
.

do
n't
try
to
be
on
of
those
peopl
who
make
so
much
of
a
film
that
thei
do
not
like
it
,
just
sit
back
,
laugh
and
enjoi
the
movi
.
