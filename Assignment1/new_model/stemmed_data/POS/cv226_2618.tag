minut
i
had
a
chanc
to
see
a
sneak
preview
of
citi
slicker
ii
on
campu
last
night
.

i
went
in
with
the
expect
of
a
film
with
the
similar
flavor
which
made
the
origin
such
a
success
:
person
growth
and
insight
humor
about
life
.

i
came
awai
somewhat
disappoint
in
thi
regard
,
get
some
of
the
latter
and
not
much
of
the
former
.

the
basic
plot

after
a

to
la

,
crystal
,

and

stai
a

extra
dai
to
go
off
in

on

thei

into
curli

twin
brother

duke
,
plai
by
-lrb-
you
know
who
-rrb-
jack
palanc
.

first
of
all
,
the
cinematographi
wa
beautifulli
done
,
especi
the
outdoor
scene
in
the
desert
.

the
scene
ar
such
that
i
would
like
to
see
some
of
those
sight
film
myself
.

there
is
some
charact
develop
dure
the
film
.

the
actor
remain
true
to
their
charact
and
plai
them
well
,
without
overplai
the
joke
.

the
movi
is
a
good
basic
adventur
,
with
enough
plot
twist
to
provid
for
an
end
that
is
difficult
to
predict
.

the
movi
is
pace
well
,
but
with
a
coupl
slow
spot
in
the
middl
and
toward
the
end
.

humor-wise
,
the
film
ha
a
good
number
of
joke
which
maintain
my
interest
throughout
the
film
.

there
ar
memor
moment
like
when
stern
is
bitten
by
a
snake
,
but
there
ar
fewer
joke
to
laugh
at
in
the
sequel
-lrb-
surpris
,
surpris
for
a
sequel
,
right
?
-rrb-
.

howev
,
the
slight
bitter
aftertast
i
have
with
thi
film
ha
to
do
mainli
with
the
film
's
manipul
of
the
audienc
.

the
film
tri
to
pull
your
heart-string
too
much
regard
how
close
the
charact
ar
to
each
other
,
like
when
mitch
had
decid
to
suck
the
snake
marrow
out
of
hi
best
friend
's
butt
.

thi
is
done
again
when
the
gang
meet
up
with
some
member
of
the
cattl
drive
group
from
the
origin
.

there
were
also
some
part
which
appear
unrealist
,
like
whether
the
stamped
would
start
in
the
wai
it
did
or
why
thei
did
n't
worri
more
about
water
while
tromp
around
the
desert
.

some
strenuou
stretch
of
the
imagin
ar
requir
here
.

sinc
the
object
of
the
gang
is
to
find
gold
and
get
rich
-lrb-
unlik
find
themselv
in
middl
ag
like
in
the
origin
-rrb-
,
i
also
found
it
harder
to
empath
with
the
charact
dure
their
journei
.

overal
,
i
'd
sai
that
the
film
is
an
entertain
and
humor
adventur
with
some
stori-line
defici
make
it
less
worthi
than
the
origin
.

it
mai
be
worth
the
full
price
of
admiss
,
but
a
matine
would
be
a
better
bargain
.
