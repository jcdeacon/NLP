''

the
tale
ha
resnai
's
uniqu
touch
as
a
director
to

it
is
a
satir
about

and
that
there
is
a
song
in

yet
it
is
not

strike

,
such
as
when

guid
in
the
meantim
and
suffer
from
panic
attack
,
even
though
she
appear
to
have
outwardli
perfect
self-control

on
her

for
the
last
four
year
ha
been
the
much
older
simon
,
pretend
to
be
do
research
for

whom
she
meet
when
look
at
her
sister
's
new
place
and
see
him
cry
but
not
realiz
that
it
wa
from
a
cold
,
not
becaus
he
's
so
sensit
.

bacri
as
the
classi
nicola
,
turn
out
to
be
now
work
as
a
chauffeur
.

he
is
a
hypochondriac
with
a
histori
of
depress
who
visit
mani
doctor
,
until
he
find
on
who
tell
him
there
is
noth
wrong
with
him
.

odil
still
pine
for
him
,
but
he
's
marri
,
tell
her
he
expect
hi
wife
to
arriv
shortli
.

love
is
`
the
same
old
song
'
that
make
the
world
go
`
round
,
even
when
all
the
charact
ar
liar
and
not
exactli
open
to
what
their
true
motiv
ar
.

everyth
come
togeth
in
a
bourgeoi
housewarm
parti
for

,
as
the
charact
reveal
their
true
feel
and
all
their
decept
and
neurot
impuls
ar
either
uncov
or
about
to
be
.

there
's
not
a
lot
of
bite
to
thi
satir
music
,
but
resnai
ha
never
made
a
bad
film
and
is
on
of
the
best
current
french
director
,
if
not
the
best
.

thi
film
is
not
on
hi
great
on
,
but
it
still
ha
enough
pep
in
it
light
touch
to
be
interest
.

it
not
onli
ha
an
odd
wai
for
the
charact
to
break
into
song
but
--
some
male
even
sing
in
a
femal
voic
while
some
femal
sing
in
a
male
voic
.

it
is
also
interest
in
the
wai
it
examin
it
charact
'
behavior
as
be
similar
in
busi
as
in
love
