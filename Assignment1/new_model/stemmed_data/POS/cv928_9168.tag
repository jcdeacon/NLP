i
swear
i
have
seen
the
edg
befor
.

in
fact
,
it
remind
me
of
the
bear
,
the
river
wild
,
and
other
variou
film
mix
into
an
entir
differ
film
.

howev
,
the
edg
ha
done
someth
that
most
action
film
should
do
,
and
that
is
add
heart
and
charact
we
like
to
the
plot
.

in
do
so
,
the
edg
draw
mani
more
suspens
moment
out
of
clich
scene
than
,
sai
,
the
peacemak
.

unfortun
,
becaus
of
those
overus
moment
,
we
can
pretti
much
guess
the
outcom
of
the
film
.

but
leav
it
to
screenwrit
david
mamet
to
add
humor
and
a
few
surpris
to
mess
with
your
head
.

on
surpris
,
in
particular
,
left
me
smile
just
becaus
mamet
actual
had
the
gut
to
add
it
to
hi
script
.

action
film
ar
a
dime
a
dozen
in
hollywood
,
and
while
thei
ar
somewhat
success
at
entertain
us
,
thei
lack
the
on
thing
which
would
make
them
a
more
respect
genr
:
intellig
.

even
horror
film
have
learn
thi
,
a
genr
which
is
probabl
the
least
respect
of
them
all
.

the
river
wild
wa
on
of
the
best
action/suspens
film
i
have
seen
from
the
90s
.

the
intellig
of
the
screenplai
,
and
the
suspens
drawn
from
the
realist
charact
is
nearli
unmatch
to
thi
dai
.

the
edg
ha
the
intellig
and
smart
charact
,
but
thi
time
the
lack
of
origin
is
the
downfal
.

i
must
admit
that
it
wa
veri
suspens
,
and
had
an
origin
third
half
,
but
the
first
hour
and
a
half
is
riddl
with
clich
and
plot
hole
.

thi
is
an
exampl
of
the
final
act
save
the
film
,
instead
of
the
other
wai
around
-lrb-
as
in
the
lost
world
-rrb-
.

if
onli
the
screenplai
had
maintain
the
final
thirti
minut
'
intens
,
it
could
have
becom
a
great
action
film
-lrb-
and
i
us
the
term
loos
-rrb-
.

the
edg
is
pretti
much
a
surviv-of-the-fittest
film
.

but
take
scream
's
lead
,
the
edg
make
fun
of
the
genr
's
clich
,
and
then
us
them
-lrb-
though
not
quit
as
effect
-rrb-
.

charl
mors
-lrb-
anthoni
hopkin
-rrb-
is
the
main
charact
,
a
rich
and
veri
intellig
man
who
wonder
what
the
accumul
of
all
thi
knowledg
ha
brought
to
him
.

for
onc
,
we
do
n't
immedi
care
for
the
main
charact
.

instead
,
we
like
bob
-lrb-
alec
baldwin
-rrb-
,
a
photograph
who
is
go
to
take
pictur
of
charl
'
wife
,
mickei
-lrb-
ell
macpherson
-rrb-
,
out
in
the
wilder
.

thei
board
a
plane
and
head
to
a
cabin
somewher
in
the
arctic
.

charl
'
birthdai
is
the
same
dai
,
and
he
receiv
a
gold
watch
from
hi
wife
,
and
a
pocket
knife
from
bob
.

as
action
film
go
,
these
item
do
have
import
to
the
rest
of
the
stori
,
but
quit
a
bit
more
than
we
first
expect
.

soon
,
howev
,
bob
want
to
find
a
nativ
to
shoot
pictur
of
becaus
of
hi
``
person
.
''

charl
,
bob
,
bob
's
assist
steve
-lrb-
harold
perrineau
-rrb-
,
and
the
pilot
head
off
to
find
him
,
and
as
shown
in
the
preview
,
hit
a
flock
of
bird
fly
south
for
the
winter
.

down
the
plane
goe
,
the
pilot
is
kill
,
and
the
three
ar
left
to
surviv
in
the
wilder
.

director
lee
tamahori
is
awar
of
the
silli
plot
which
is
about
to
follow
,
and
therefor
ha
to
creat
origin
wai
to
approach
the
situat
.

he
succe
often
enough
for
us
to
enjoi
the
film
.

take
,
for
instanc
,
the
entir
man-hunt
bear
plot
.

thi
ha
been
done
mani
time
in
film
with
differ
anim
,
and
even
bear
.

but
given
the
charl
'
intellig
,
and
bob
's
uncertainti
,
mani
of
the
clich
ar
given
fresh
twist
.

even
charl
himself
seem
to
have
seen
these
action
film
befor
.

my
favorit
line
of
the
film
come
from
charl
:
``
most
peopl
die
in
the
wilder
becaus
thei
did
n't
do
the
on
thing
that
could
save
their
life
...
think
.
''

despit
the
predict
of
the
main
plot
,
a
subplot
develop
late
in
the
film
which
took
me
by
surpris
,
and
made
me
smile
when
i
realiz
that
everyth
is
n't
as
it
seem
anymor
.

i
have
to
write
cautious
as
to
not
reveal
thi
surpris
,
so
instead
i
will
avoid
it
entir
.

the
first
two-third
of
the
edg
have
mani
humor
moment
to
push
it
along
,
and
some
of
charl
'
surviv
techniqu
seem
possibl
,
even
make
fire
from
ic
.

tamahori
is
abl
to
creat
a
lot
of
suspens
from
the
stalk
bear
,
but
whenev
the
bear
is
present
,
the
charact
lose
all
sensibl
.

i
have
alwai
wonder
why
charact
in
film
walk
over
a
log
to
get
across
water
.

why
not
do
what
an
intellig
person
would
and
crawl
across
?

i
guess
get
chase
by
a
bear
make
your
thought
process
turn
off
for
a
while
.

thankfulli
,
we
alreadi
have
begun
to
care
for
the
charact
,
and
so
we
let
thi
small
detail
slide
.

but
some
of
the
technic
detail
ar
awkward
,
such
as
the
nice
stitch
done
on
the
fur
coat
that
charl
and
bob
make
-lrb-
where
did
thei
get
thread
and
needl
?
-rrb-
.

the
act
of
the
film
is
highli
abov
averag
for
a
film
of
thi
natur
,
and
border
on
phenomen
.

anthoni
hopkin
give
a
terrif
perform
,
creat
hi
most
likeabl
and
layer
charact
sinc
remain
of
the
dai
.

hopkin
usual
bring
great
to
hi
role
,
but
here
he
exce
at
gain
the
audienc
'
sympathi
,
someth
he
definit
did
not
do
in
silenc
of
the
lamb
.

alec
baldwin
give
on
of
hi
best
perform
i
have
ever
seen
-lrb-
it
sure
is
better
from
hi
fair
game
-rrb-
.

baldwin
can
be
a
good
or
a
bad
charact
,
and
here
he
succe
at
both
in
a
wai
.

you
can
never
quit
guess
if
he
is
a
nice
or
a
vllainou
charact
until
the
end
,
and
baldwin
is
abl
to
handl
the
doubl-natur
photograph
.

ell
macpherson
give
a
good
perform
,
albeit
slight
.

she
is
n't
in
the
film
all
that
much
,
but
for
the
scene
she
doe
have
,
she
handl
as
an
actress
,
not
as
a
model
.

harold
perrineau
is
a
good
actor
,
and
hi
scene
ar
nice
and
underplai
.

he
is
elimin
earli
,
and
i
reveal
noth
by
sai
thi
becaus
it
is
inevit
and
predict
.

the
edg
is
rate
r
for
graphic
violenc
,
some
gore
,
and
languag
.

some
of
the
violenc
is
a
littl
too
disturb
,
even
for
me
.

thi
film
is
a
nice
chang
from
the
mindless
action
most
of
us
ar
us
to
,
but
too
mani
clich
bog
it
down
.

director
tamahori
ha
creat
a
veri
smooth
and
suspens
action
film
out
of
recycl
part
.

david
mamet
's
script
,
though
,
ha
a
lot
of
humor
to
keep
the
first
hour
afloat
,
and
the
act
is
solid
.

the
best
thing
about
the
script
is
the
end
which
doe
n't
end
with
the
normal
high-strung
action
sequenc
,
but
with
a
small
detail
involv
a
certain
gift
.

it
's
a
nice
touch
consid
what
we
have
had
to
go
through
with
the
bear
.

and
by
the
wai
,
most
peopl
laugh
when
the
film
fade
to
black
due
to
a
larg
credit
to
bart
the
bear
.

wai
to
go
,
bart
.
