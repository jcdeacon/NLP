in

1977

the

in

rate
it

the

like
so
mani
previou

i
must
note
that
i
watch
star

for
the
first
time
twenti

and
that
i
remain
enchant
by
the

perhap
it

,
until
then
unimagin

wonder
that
happen
long

in

or
perhap
it
wa
the
rush
i
felt
minut
befor
the
open

,
with
my
expect
alreadi
pump
up
by

anywai
,
watch
of
star

wa
on
of
the
most
import
movi
go
experi
of
my
life
.

and
it
wa
also
unmatch
for
mani
year
to
come
,
becaus
veri
few
movi
manag
to
have
such
a
strong
impact
on
me
like
georg

'
epic
.

star
war
wa
n't
just
import
movi
for
me
-lrb-
or
the
million
of
fan
who
probabl
share
the
same
sentiment
-rrb-
.

it
wa
the
defin
moment
in
the
histori
of
modern

.

until

wa
in

;
social

in

practic
destroi
the
old

and
new

fill
the
void
,
mostli
by
us
hollywood
's
financi
and
technic
resourc
to
creat
seriou
,
``

``

movi

as
a
result
,
audienc
,
traumatis
of
dark

of
vietnam

waterg
,
did
n't
want
to
see
the
same
dark
and
seriou
content
on
the
silver
screen
.

georg
luca
with
it
scienc
fiction
epic
wa
among
the
first
to
come
into

the
audienc
respond
with
unpreced

huge

later
back

slowli
began
to
chang

seriou

with

ambit
fade
into
oblivion
,
and
were
replac
by
industri
product
of
``
blockbust

philosophi
.

on
of
the
biggest
casualti
of
that
trend
wa
the
scienc
fiction
movi
genr
.

until
1977
,
scienc
fiction
movi
were
mostli
in
b-product

.

in
late
1960s
,
bigger

did
n't
look
so
strang
anymor
,
thank
to
the
great
success
of
2001
:
a

but
the
same
success
coincid
with
the
surg
of
pesim
,
and
hollywood
scienc
fiction
wa
as
bleak
as
the
rest
of
it
product-mostli
dark

dystop

.

howev
,
in

star

show
onc
and
for
all
that
thi
genr
can
be
inspir
for
popular
movi
,
even
among
the
audienc
that
usual

n't

as
a

critic
who
do

like

,
especi
those
who
ca
n't
forgiv
luca
for
hi
contribut
to
the
quash
of
``
new
hollywood
''
,
ar
prone
to
point
the
lack
of
origin
.

on
the
surfac
,
thei
might
be
right
;
luca
himself
admit
that
he
found
a
lot
of
inspir
in
the
lore
of
old
hollywood-western
,
wwii
aviat
movi
,
old
sf
cliffhang
serial
of
the
1930s
and
1940s
;
yet
the
most
obviou
element
would
be
akira
kurosawa
's
samurai
classic
the
hidden
fortress
.

on
the
other
hand
,
those
who
had
spent
last
two
decad
studi
the
movi
to
death
would
sai
that
the
inspir
for
star
war
went
even
further-into
collect
subconsci
of
western
civilis
-lrb-
hint
by
some
mild
tolkien
refer
-rrb-
.

the
other
would
find
the
author
's
element
within
the
stori-star
war
could
be
seen
as
an
anti-establish
film
;
young
,
long-hair
,
easi
go
,
natur-love
hero
ar
fight
against
old
,
uptight
and
oppress
forc
who
us
supertechnolog
in
most
demon
purpos
.

even
out
of
it
histor
or
social
context
,
star
war
is
an
impress
as
a
strictli
technic
piec
of
the
seven
art
.

georg
luca
'
direct
is
veri
good
,
with
the
clever
edit
and
a
well-pace
segment
between
action
and
dramat
buildup
.

charact
ar
well-drawn
and
deliv
all
the
necessari
ingredi
,
both
for
the
space
opera
and
hollywood
blockbust
.

we
have
a
``
come-of-ag
''
hero
,
damsel-in-distress
-lrb-
somewhat
tone
down
due
to
the
popular
feminist
trend
of
the
time
-rrb-
,
reluct
helper
,
benevol
mentor
,
diabol
villain
and
,
final
,
comic
relief
in
form
of
two
non-human
charact
.

some
of
the
actor
ar
veri
good-alec
guiness
in
hi
most
famou
role
to
date
,
jame
earl
jone
whose
voic
is
enough
to
caus
uneas
,
peter
cush
as
an
incarn
of
pure
evil
in
human
form
.

unfortun
,
the
same
ca
n't
be
said
for
the
main
lead-among
the
main
trio
of
mark
hamil
,
carri
fisher
and
harrison
ford
,
onli
the
last
on
had
the
charact
three-dimension
enough
to
launch
hi
further
act
career
.

the
thing
that
look
like
the
most
import
segment
of
star
war
phenomena
dure
it
initi
releas
wa
the
new
level
of
special
effect
technolog
.

often
comparison
with
2001
:
space
odyssei
,
anoth
ground-break
sf
film
,
were
cite
the
sheer
number
of
effect
as
a
proof
of
the
luca
'
superior
over
kubrick
.

howev
,
the
special
effect
by
john
dykstra
and
john
stear
ar
inde
impress
,
even
after
two
decad
-lrb-
although
1997
special
edit
did
improv
them
significantli
-rrb-
,
yet
thei
ar
n't
the
most
rememb
trademark
of
the
movi
.

that
honour
should
definit
go
to
the
``
oscar
''
-
win
soundtrack
by
john
william
,
whose
work
on
star
war
is
probabl
the
brightest
gem
in
hi
brilliant
career
.

newer
gener
of
viewer
might
be
somewhat
depriv
of
the
enchant
that
still
hold
those
lucki
enough
to

.

yet
,
even
if
thei
ar

thei
should

nevertheless
,
