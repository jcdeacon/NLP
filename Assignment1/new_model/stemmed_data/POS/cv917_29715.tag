paul
walker
realli
surpris
me
in
thi
movi
,
sinc
i
've
never
much
thought
of
him
as
anyth
more
than
a
pretti
face
-lrb-
and
damn
,
is
it
ever
pretti
or
what
?!
-rrb-

but
here
,
he
actual
manag
to
put
some
depth
behind
the
look
and
that
's
alwai
appreci
in
film
in
which
you
ar
so
close
ti
to
the
main
charact
.

sobieski
is
also
good
,
but
she
is
n't
in
the
movi
for
as
long
as
you
'd
think
,
but
the
man
who
realli
take
thi
film
to
anoth
level
,
is
steve
zahn
.

if
you
've
love
thi
gui
as
the
``
goofbal
''
in
most
of
hi
previou
role
,
you
'll
appreci
him
even
more
here
,
as
the
dude
who
start
off
as
on
of
the
most
manic
and
excit
human
be
i
've
seen
in
quit
some
time
-lrb-
``
thi
is
so
awesom
!!
''
-rrb-

,
onli
to
turn
into
a
man
scare
out
of
hi
wit
by
the
end
of
the
flick
.

and
speak
of
the
end
,
boi
,
doe
thi
movi
deliv
some
chill
moment
dure
it
finalclick
or
what
?!?
the
arrow
and
i
were
practic
in
each
other
arm
-lrb-
well
,
mayb
i
'm
exagger
,
but
you
catch
my
drift
-rrb-
as
each
minut
brought
about
anoth
turn
of
event
which
in
turn
,
took
it
all
to
an
even
higher
level
.

onc
again
,
kudo
to
director
dahl
for
be
abl
to
gener
that
type
of
intens
,
suspens
and
tension
,
with
a
great
score
,
edit
,
style
and
camerawork
.

plot-wise
,
i
too
did
wonder
how
the
``
bad
gui
''
wa
abl
to
track
them
so
well
,
but
it
did
n't
realli
bother
me
all
that
much
-lrb-
you
can
assum
that
he
had
bug
their
car
?
-rrb-
.

but
pretti
much
everyth
els
in
the
stori
stuck
like
glue
and
i
could
n't
help
but
put
myself
in
their
shoe
and
appreci
their
thoroughli
desper
circumst
.

a
great
movi
with
an
even
cooler
end
,
thi
film
will
like
be
rememb
as
on
of
the
better
thriller
of
the
year
.

``
thi
is
amaz
!!!
