,
but
it
realli
captur
your
interest
.

with
great
perform
by
ralph
fienn
-lrb-
do
anoth
english
patient
type
of
film
,
onli
thi
movi
is
better
-rrb-
and
julianna
moor
who
definit
deserv
an
oscar
becaus
out
of
allfilm
she
did
in
1999
,
i
believ
thi
wa
the
role
,
she
had
the
most
passion
for
,
and
you
can
see
why
.

the
stori
wa
also
well
written
thank
to
neil
jordan
.

even
though
i
did
n't
read
the
book
,
there
's
no
doubt
in
mind
that
it
wa
just
as
move
and
descript
.

what
's
so
move
about
it
you
ask
?

the
tragedi
of
it
all
.

it
's
not
the
typic
romanc
,
in
which
a
gui
find
a
girl
,
thei
fall
in
love
and
all
is
well
,
thi
is
more
complic
and
depress
.

it
realli
show
the
complex
of
a
relationship
,
becaus
noth
is
ever
perfect
.

everyon
feel
a
differ
wai
and
that
is
what
tear
us
to
piec
.

back
to
neil
jordan
's
script
,
it
wa
n't
onli
red
rose
.

there
were
time
when
i
felt
it
too
be
a
littl
slow
,
but
most
romanc
ar
.

it
also
tend
to
be
a
bit
confus
,
especi
at
the
start
.

it
keep
jump
around
from
past
to
present
,
so
it
obvious
took
awhil
to
get
a
grasp
of
thing
.

also
a
notabl
wa
the
superb
direct
by
neil
jordan
.

i
'd
have
to
sai
thi
is
hi
finest
achiev
to
date
,
becaus
quit
frankli
i
've
never
realli
found
hi
work
to
be
up
to
par
.

it
just
never
did
anyth
for
me
,
until
now
.

when
it
end
,
it
leav
viewer
a
littl
sadden
,
but
provok
nonetheless
.

thi
is
definit
on
of
the
best
film
of
99
,
and
had
some
of
the
best
act
,
most
notabl
by
moor
.

not
for
all
movi
goer
,
but
for
those
who
ar
film
buff
and
want
someth
of
valu
.
