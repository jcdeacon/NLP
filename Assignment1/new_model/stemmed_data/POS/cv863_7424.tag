not
sinc
attend
an
ingmar
bergman
retrospect
a
few
year
ago
have
i
seen
a
film
as
uncompromis
in
it
portray
of
emot
truth
as
secret
&
li
.

like
bergman
,
director
mike
leigh
is
interest
in
probe
hi
charact
'
inner
depth
through
hypernatur
blunt
confront
.

also
like
bergman
,
leigh
engag
in
frequent
closeup
of
hi
charact
'
ravish
and
wrack
face
.

and
the
promin
mourn
of
a
cello
on
the
soundtrack
recal
bergman
's
own
us
of
a
bach
cello
suit
in
an
earlier
film
.

all
that
is
miss
is
a
discuss
of
god
.

which
is
not
to
sai
that
secret
&
li
is
noth
more
than
an
homag
to
the
swedish
master
.

in
fact
,
it
is
quit
possibl
leigh
had
no
such
intent
in
mind
.

nonetheless
,
what
we
get
is
so
far
remov
from
the
averag
moviego
experi
--
even
from
the
reason
we
go
to
the
movi
in
the
first
place
--
that
it
take
some
effort
to
adjust
to
the
film
's
rhythm
.

onc
the
adjust
is
made
,
howev
,
there
ar
great
reward
.

on
such
is
the
chanc
to
see
life
on
the
screen
as
it
realli
is
.

though
leigh
mai
have
adopt
some
of
bergman
's
stylist
touch
,
most
obvious
in
an
earli
scene
of
ters
cross-cut
dure
a
marri
coupl
's
strain
convers
,
as
well
as
in
that
somewhat
obtrus
score
,
the
overal
feel
of
the
film
is
that
it
eschew
ani
``
style
''
at
all
.

wherea
bergman
us
artific
as
a
tool
to
expos
realiti
,
leigh
make
the
camera
a
mere
observ
,
almost
as
in
a
pb
documentari
.

the
effect
of
thi
is
to
focu
all
of
your
attent
on
the
actor
.

it
is
a
tribut
to
everyon
involv
that
,
despit
such
scrutini
,
onli
infrequ
ar
we
awar
that
anyon
*
is
*
act
.

much
ha
been
made
of
brenda
blethyn
's
perform
,
and
rightli
so
,
but
it
is
onli
when
you
remind
yourself
that
you
ar
watch
a
fiction
that
you
realiz
how
good
she
is
.

there
ar
a
few
misstep
.

for
on
,
except
for
on
scene
-lrb-
tragicom
,
as
it
happen
-rrb-
,
there
is
scant
humor
in
the
film
.

thi
lead
to
a
certain
monoton
tone
throughout
.

and
occasion
-lrb-
as
with
bergman
-rrb-
the
blunt
of
the
situat
can
seem
forc
.

for
all
that
,
thi
longish
film
manag
to
keep
hold
of
your
attent
.

it
is
unfortun
that
the
audienc
for
secret
&
li
will
most
like
be
limit
to
an
intellectu
elit
,
for
there
is
noth
inher
intellectu
about
thi
film
.

in
fact
,
it
might
easili
reson
more
strongli
for
million
of
work
class
filmgoer
who
will
like
never
see
it
.

there
is
even
a
sweet
but
signific
ironi
in
the
film
's
unspoken
take
on
race
relat
,
someth
an
american
audienc
at
least
would
do
well
to
observ
.

nonetheless
,
secret
&
li
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
.

though
there
is
noth
physic
horrif
to
make
on
squeamish
,
the
explor
of
common
human
frailti
can
be
so
raw
and
unspar
that
it
is
tempt
to
turn
from
the
screen
.

needless
to
sai
,
it
is
also
veri
depress
at
time
.

but
for
mani
of
us
,
of
cours
,
so
is
life
.

and
though
the
film
is
too
honest
to
tack
on
a
phoni
happi
end
,
that
same
honesti
allow
it
to
admit
that
thing
can
also
get
better
.
