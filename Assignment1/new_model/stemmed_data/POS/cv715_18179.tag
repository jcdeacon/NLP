.

realli
,
it
's
all
confus
to
keep
track
of
in
review
format
,
your
best
bet
is
to
just
,
well
,
go
.

the
movi
featur
some
veri
good
act
from
all
angl
,
and
limon
add
the
same
humor
energi
he
had
with
swinger
to
thi
particular
product
.

the
dialogu
is
pretti
snappi
and
the
resolut
is
pretti
well
realiz
,
not
go
for
the
sappi
happi
end
nor
the
dread
bad
end
.

think
of
it
as
a
,
well
,
end
.

the
intertwin
of
stori
is
a
particularli
good
element
to
the
movi
,
as
it
's
never
realli
confus
and
tell
differ
side
of
the
stori
,
like
slide
door
kinda
did
.

howev
,
it
's
better
suit
for
the
younger
gener
who
want
a
littl
spice
in
their
flick
,
which
slide
door
kinda
is
n't
.

how
the
hell
did
i
get
to
slide
door
all
of
a
sudden
?

how
annoi
...
