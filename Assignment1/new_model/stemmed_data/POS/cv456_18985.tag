it
's
no
classic
,
but
thi
new
tarzan
repres
exactli
what
a
famili
film
should
be
.

the
plot
is
loyal
to

,
as
tarzan

,
in

disnei
film
we
ar
given
some
kind
of
goofi
sidekick

in

these

fill
that

rather
inconspicu

gag
that
were

the

stumbl

nice
vocal
by
a
cheer
minni
driver
-rrb-
who
will
help
suppli
the
romant
quotient
of
the
movi
.

the
thing
that
blew
my
sock
off
about
thi
version
of
tarzan
is
the
stun
anim
.

director
chri
buck
and
kevin
lima
have
appli
a
breathtak
3-d
element
to
the
movement
of
the
athlet
titl
charact
,
and
the
fast-pace
edit
is
absolut
a
marvel
.

as
tarzan
carri
jane
through
the
treetop
,
narrowli
escap
a
pack
of
nasti
baboon
,
he
slip
and
slide
like
a
daredevil
snow
boarder
or
star
surfer
ride
the
big
wave
.

your
ey
can
bare
keep
up
;
it
's
a
fantast
accomplish
.

the
subject
matter
here
is
also
a
notch
or
two
abov
anim
averag
.

there
ar
import
question
rais
about
tarzan
's
place
in
the
world
,
and
all
ar
handl
exception
well
by
the
screenwrit
.

there
is
no
shred
of
doubt
left
to
ponder
afterward
,
which
is
a
surpris
plu
that
i
wa
n't
expect
to
find
here
.

suffic
to
sai
,
thi
film
will
have
both
adult
and
children
thoroughli
entertain
.

the
grown-up
tarzan
is
voic
by
toni
goldwyn
,
who
made
a
name
for
himself
as
the
`
big
mean
jerk
'
from
ghost
.

goldwyn
is
effect
plai
someon
who
's
not
awar
of
hi
world
's
danger
.

glenn
close
is
also
memor

hi
gorilla
mother
,
and
lanc
henriksen
-lrb-
from
tv
's
millennium
-rrb-
is
terrif
as
the
silverback
father
unsur
of
how
to
accept
the
presenc
of
a
human
child
.

as
the
movi
's
villain
,
there
is
noth
particularli
special
or
catch
about
the
charact
of
clayton
.

it
help
that
brian
bless
suppli
hi
voic
with
game
enthusiasm
,
but
he
is
noth
compar
to

still
,
thi
is
on

i
never
