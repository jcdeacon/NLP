mel
gibson
as
jerri
fletcher
,
a
fast-talk
,
witti
,
comic
taxi
driver
in
new
york
citi
.

gibson
's
perform
is
terrif
,
and
hi
charact
is
similar
to
that
of
martin
rigg
in
the
lethal
weapon
film
.

gibson
again
team
up
with
richard
donner
,
as
he
did
in
the
lethal
weapon
film
and
maverick
,
and
thi
time
around
,
the
combin
work
even
better
.

the
charact
of
jerri
fletcher
is
inde
uniqu
.

try
to
imagin
a
tone-down
version
of
travi
bickl
who
,
thi
time
around
,
is
a
jitteri
gui
with
knowledg
of
govern
conspiraci
cover-up
.

if
you
can
imagin
that
,
then
you
've
basic
got
jerri
fletcher
.

in
mani
wai
,
i
wa
surpris
by
thi
movi
.

to
begin
with
,
i

secondli
,
i
wa
surpris
at
mel
gibson
's
perform
.

he

a
fantast
perform
.

the
preview
of
thi
film
led
me
to
believ
it
wa
an
all-out
action
flick
,
which
after
view
,
it
wa
almost
the
opposit
in
a
certain
sens
.

gibson
's
charact
ha
an
almost
uncount
number
of
on-liner
,
hilari
situat
,
and
hi
charact
is
on
that
the
audienc
tend
to
side
with
throughout
the
film
.

for
instanc
,
jerri
's
apart
-lrb-
and
especi
hi
secur
-rrb-
is
memor
.

and
last
,
i
wa
surpris
at
how
good
the
plot
is
.

writer
brian
helgeland
ha
creat
a
terrif
stori
,
and
when
watch
thi
film
,
you
ar
left
to
wonder
if
all
of
jerri
fletcher
's
far-fetch
-lrb-
or
so
thei
seem
at
first
-rrb-
conspiraci
theori
ar
helgeland
's
own
opinion
.

mel
gibson
is
n't
the
onli
stand-out
in
the
film
.

julia
robert
is
veri
good
in
her
perform
as
alic
sutton
,
the
depart
of
justic
employe
who
ca
n't
seem
to
stai
awai
from
jerri
fletcher
,
who
continu
visit
alic
in
hope
that
she
will
do
someth
about
hi
theori
.

he
also
seem
obsess
and
in
love
with
her
.

but
whenev
he
approach
her
with
anoth
on
of
hi
theori
,
she
shrug
him
and
hi
belief
off
,
continu
note
that
on
dai
she
is
go
to
slap
a
restrain
order
on
him
.

jerri
,
obvious
determin
to
continu
seek
out
the
truth
,
continu
to
research
inform
for
hi

conspiraci
theori
,
which
will
be

hi
newslett
-lrb-
same

although

,
he
put
a
larg
amount
of
time
and
effort
into
hi
work
,
and

escap
aliv
,
jerri
