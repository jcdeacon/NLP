the
butcher
boi
-lrb-
r
-rrb-
.

no
film
in
recent
ha
left
me
with
such
conflict
feel
as
neil
jordan
's
harrow
,
humor
,
horrifi
adapt
of
patrick
mccabe
's
novel
about
young
lad
franci
bradi
's
-lrb-
eamonn
owen
-rrb-
descent
into
mad
in
1960s
ireland
.

on
on
hand
,
it
wa
difficult
for
me
to
becom
invest
in
franci
's
stori
becaus
he
is
such
an
unsavori
charact
,
unjustify
vent
hi
rage
at
hi
nosi
but
otherwis
harmless
neighbor
mr.
nugent
-lrb-
fiona
shaw
-rrb-
.

on
anoth
hand
,
i
found
it
difficult
to
laugh
at
some
of
franci
's
darkli
comic
shenanigan
becaus
he
obvious
is
such
a
sick
,
needi
child
,
have
been
rais
by
a
drunken
father
-lrb-
stephen
rea
-rrb-
and
a
suicid
mother
-lrb-
aisl
o'sullivan
-rrb-
.

on
yet
anoth
hand
,
i
also
found
it
difficult
to
complet
sympath
with
franci
dure
hi
more
emot
scene
becaus
some
of
hi
,
for
lack
of
a
better
word
,
``
bad
''
deed
ar
so
incred
shock
in
their
brutal
and
the
malici
glee
in
which
he
perform
them
.

howev
,
the
butcher
boi
's
power
is
undeni
,
and
the
film
as
a
whole
is
unforgett
--
perhap
becaus
it
is
so
disturb
.

what
make
it
so
unsettl
is
the
franci
's
overal
wink-wink
yet
matter-of-fact
attitud
about
everyth
,
express
in
a
cheeki
voiceov
narrat
deliv
by
the
adult
franci
-lrb-
rea
again
-rrb-
.

think
heavenli
creatur
plai
larg
for
laugh
,
and
you
'll
sort
of
understand
.

anchor
the
whole
film
is
the
astonish
debut
perform
of
owen
;
love
franci
or
hate
him
,
you
can
not
take
your
ey
off
of
owen
.

the
butcher
boi
truli
is
a
twist
,
unusu
film
that
is
bound
to
make
just
about
anyon
uncomfort
.

in
the
lobbi
after
the
screen
,
i
overheard
on
man
rave
about
how
great
yet
disturb
it
wa
;
i
also
heard
on
particularli
offend
woman
sai
with
disgust
,
``
that
movi
wa
so
unfunni
!
