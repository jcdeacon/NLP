it
's
an
interest
premis

our
realiti
is
onli
real
to
us
becaus
it
is
what
we
perceiv
to
be
real
.

in
truth
,
our
entir
exist
ar
live
out
in
our
mind
as
we
ar
fed
inform
through
electron
input
directli
to
our
brain
.

what
we
see
,
what
we
do
,
everyth
around
us
is
noth
more
than
a
comput-gener
construct
interlink
with
the
mind
of
other
through
a
vastli
power
artifici
intellig

our
bodi
,
sever
atrophi
,
ar
kept
aliv
for
the
sole
purpos
of
gener
heat
and
electr
energi
for
a
domin
order
of
machin
which
control
the
planet
.

the
sci-fi
realm
ha
been
wait
a
littl
while
for
someth
new
to
come
along
.

the
matrix
is
n't
it-the
idea
of
a
war
between
man
and
a
sentient
comput
network
,
a
sham
world
,
the
abil
to
plug
on
's
brain
into
a
comput
,
ha
all
been
glean
from
such
sourc
as
the
termin
,
dark
citi
,
and
a
few
star
trek
episod
-lrb-
both
classic
and
next
gener
-rrb-
.

what
is
new
is
the
abil
to
weav
all
of
these
variou
element
togeth
and
succe
in
produc
a
film
that
is
both
entertain
as
well
as
thought-provok
.

keanu

a

nicknam
neo
,
who
is
pluck
out
of
the
artifici
world
-lrb-
known
as
the
matrix
-rrb-
by
a
group
of
renegad
human
who
ar
clandestin
fight
to
expos
the
fallaci
of
the
comput-gener
exist
and
free
humankind
from
the
oppress
of
the
machin
.

the
group
's
leader
,
morpheu
-lrb-
laurenc
fishburn
-rrb-
,
ha
chosen
neo
becaus
he
believ
neo
is
``
the
on
''
who
is
destin
to
lead
the
attack
against
the
artifici

.

>
from
the
begin
of
the
film
,
we
ar
kept
on
our
toe
try
to
figur
thing
out
.

thi
,
in
a
lesser
movi
would
be
annoi
,
but
the
matrix
present
itself
in
an
intellig
manner
which
make
the
puzzl
rather
interest
and
even
fun
.

what
is
realiti
?

what
is
a
sham
?

the
film
turn
our
veri
percept
of
life
on
it
side
.

more
than
onc
,
we
ar
also
present
with
the
question
of
whether
we
would
rather
know
the
harsh
truth
of
realiti
,
or
live
a
life
of
rel
bliss
,
oblivi
to
the
true
natur
of
our
surround
.

as
viewer
,
thi
is
intrigu
enough
,
so
imagin
what
it
would
be
like
for
neo
.

and
who
to
better
plai
a
bewild
person
than
keanu
reev
?

reev
,
whom
i
've
never
realli
care
for
as
an
actor
,
is
compet
in
role
which
requir
a
lot
of
straightforward
,
and
littl
subtleti
.

he
wa
good
in
speed
,
for
exampl
,
but
laughabl
poor
in
a
walk
in
the
cloud
.

neo
is
actual
on
of
those
role
which
reev
slip
into
rather
nice
,
so
much
of
my
expect
wa
happili
for

in
a
coupl
of

the
script
even

thi
is
a

credit

what

more

fishburn
also
maintain
a
certain

about

of

is

from

we

an

much
of

seem

the
combin

a

there

when

much
is
made
of
the

it

the

is
not

some

ar
``

a

on

some
