usual
when
on
is
debat
who
the
modern
queen
of
the
romant
comedi
is
thei
will
bring
up
name
like
julia
robert
or
sandra
bullock
.

other
will
mention
meg
ryan
.

but
for
me
,
it
's
not
even
close
.

janean
garofalo
is
not
onli
the
queen
of
the
romant
comedi
,
she
is
the
best
comic
actress
in
hollywood
right
now
.

and
it
's
a
good
thing
she
's
star
in
the
matchmak
,
becaus
without
her
presenc
the
movi
would
be
bland
,
unfunni
,
and
dull
.

garofalo
star
as
marci
tizard
,
a
top
aid
to
boston
senat
john
mcglori
,
who
is
suffer
in
the
poll
.

in
an
attempt
to
captur
the
irish
vote
,
he
send
marci
on
a
mission
to
a
small
irish
town
call
ballinagra
in
search
of
other
mcglori
's
that
never
move
to
america
.

unfortun
for
marci
,
her
visit
coincid
with
the
town
's
annual
matchmak
festiv
.

thing
get
off
to
a
rocki
start
for
marci
though
.

she
ha
no
hotel
reserv
-lrb-
for
no
ration
reason
-rrb-
and
the
tini
confin
room
-lrb-
tire
old
clich
'
-rrb-
she
ha
to
stai
in
ha
a
visitor
in
her
bathtub
.

hi
name
is
sean
,
and
marci
find
him
repugn
at
first
,
so
you
can
obvious
tell
where
thi
is
head
.

the
movi
run
into
a
few
roadblock
.

for
instanc
,
the
stori
is
veri
thin
.

none
of
the
charact
-lrb-
except
the
old
local
matchmak
-rrb-
ar
nearli
as
interest
as
garofalo
.

some
of
the
charact
,
like
the
polit
aid
plai
by
deni
leari
,
have
wander
in
from
a
complet
differ
movi
.

i
think
the
director
realiz
thi
and
decid
to
throw
in
numer
shot
of
the
beauti
irish
sceneri
,
and
sever
close-up
of
garofalo
's
win
smile
.

the
strang
thing
is
that
it
work
.

garofalo
's
charm
and
the
irish
sceneri
could
carri
the
thinnest
of
stori
,
and
it
carri
thi
on
.
