the
good
side
:
some
neat
scene
of
vampir
and
violenc
.

the
bad
:
no
scare
.

ye
that
's
right
,
even
though
be
direct
by
on
of
horror
's
most
cherish
director
,
`
vampir
'
is
the
least
bit
scari
,
if
not
at
all
.

,
find
an
abandon
hous

.

of
cours
we
all
know
sunshin
kill
vampir
,
and
that
is
just
how
thei
kill
these
vampir
:
hook
them
to
rope
and
drag
them
outsid
let
them
burn
to
death
.

after
throw
a
parti
for
what
happen
,
the
vampir
that
did
not
die
come
back
to
trash
it
.

thei
kill
almost
all
of

turn

thei

fight
thei
're
wai
against
vampir
,
lead
up
to
a
final
that
is
well-done
with
great
special
effect
.

`
vampir
'
defin
could
have
been
done
better
.

the
make-up
,
special
effect
and
stori
ar
first
rate
,
but
there
is
no
scare
or
terror
that
the
film
could
have
had
.

it
to
me
had
more
humor
than
horror
,
almost
be
compar
to
`
fright
night
'
with
the
mix
of
violenc
and
comedi
.

john
carpent
doe
a
great
job
of
direct
thi
film
.

he
eas
through
some
tough
time
and
save
the
flaw
,
which
ar
notic
but
forgett
.

the
script
is
clever
and
funni
,
with
mani
line
that
make
us
laugh
out
loud
.

i
much
enjoi
`
vampir
'
with
a
few
except
.

it
's
on
of
those
film
you
see
but
do
n't
take
to
heart
.

you
enjoi
the
time
you
spent
and
go
on
.

the
recent
releas
`
psycho
'
is
the
same
wai
,
it
's
not
as
good
as
you
'd
hope
but
it
is
fun
and
entertain
.

`
vampir
'
is
a
good
horror
flick
with
no
scare
but
plenti
of
other
content
to
pleas
the
viewer
.
