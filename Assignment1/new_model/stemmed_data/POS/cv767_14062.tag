is
jimmi
stewart
the
greatest
actor
of
all-time
?

it
's
quit
possibl
.

hi
career
span
overyear
,
and
he
act
in
more
movi
than
most
actor
ever
could
.

yet
,
when
he
is
talk
about
in
the
media
,
he
is
gener
thought
of
as
an
actor
who
plai
on
type
of
role
:
the
nice
gui
.

and
that
's
realli
a
shame
.

``
the
nake
spur
''
featur
jimmi
stewart
in
a
role
complet
differ
than
what
peopl
would
expect
from
him
.

it
's
a
western
,
which
stewart
special
in
around
thi
period
,
and
it
cast
him
as
a
desper
man
out
to
collect
a
bounti
on
a
man
who
us
to
be
hi
friend
.

befor
he
find
that
man
,
though
,
he
run
into
two
men
who
agre
to
help
him
,
think
he
is
a
sheriff
.

when
the
crimin
is
eventu
caught
,
the
two
men
discov
stewart
's
secret
,
and
decid
thei
want
a
piec
of
the
action
too
.

the
rest
of
the
film
is
a
suspens
journei
in
which
each
man
suspect
the
other
constantli
.

also
featur
is
the
woman
travel
with
the
crimin
,
well
plai
by
janet
leigh
.

we
're
never
too
sure
who
's
side
she
's
realli
on
until
the
end
.

leigh
is
an
actress
probabl
best
known
for
her
role
as
the
``
shower
ladi
''
from
``
psycho
''
,
and
that
's
unfair
.

she
give
a
strong
perform
as
a
woman
who
is
pull
between
these
two
men
.

stewart
give
a
perform
unlik
anyth
i
've
ever
seen
from
him
.

he
usual
keep
cool
no
matter
what
occur
,
but
here
,
he
get
downright
hyster
at
time
.

i
think
perhap
he
took
thi
role
to
prove
to
the
public
that
he
wa
more
than
just
a
``
nice
gui
''
.

hi
perform
border
on
psychot
at
time
,
but
i
love
watch
everi
second
of
it
.

it
's
role
like
thi
on
that
make
me
admir
him
as
much
as
i
do
.

he
wa
an
actor
unafraid
to
take
chanc
,
and
even
ruin
hi
public
imag
.
