and
for
at

it
first
half-hour
the
pictur

``
beauti

''
-
like
scenario
is
-lrb-
romant
-rrb-
escap
of
the
highest
order
.

as
with
groundhog
dai
or
pleasantvil
,
while
watch
the
high-concept

imagin
him/herself
in

;
it
's
william
's
ordinary
that
entic
the

bore
anna
.

curti
-lrb-
who
previous
pen
four
wed

a

-rrb-
is
also
smart
enough
to
know
that
the
unlik
coupl
's
situat
is
not
enough
to
fuel
two
hour

worth
of
entertain
,
so
some
of
not

's
finest
moment
revolv
around
william
's
eccentr
friend
and
famili
.

by
now
,
dear

probabl
heard
a

ye
,
he
's
a
crowd
pleaser
,
a
walk

gag
,
but
hi
charact
is
not
nearli
as
involv
as
the
wheelchair-bound
-lrb-
and
appropri
name
-rrb-
bella
-lrb-

,
the

of

of

in
the

best
sequenc
,
william
,
anna
,
and
compani
sit
around
bloat
from
max

latest
concoct
and
hold
a
contest
:
the
last

-lrb-
worth
note
in
robert

:
the
ubiquit
``
i

her
''
episod
is
not
nearli
so
syrupi
as
it
appear
in

and
it
featur
some
of
the
best
