.

the

begin
to
go
off

end
at
thi
point
,
when
the
result
is
a
beauti
young
girl
who
can
shape-shift
into
ani
of

the

the
alien

,
struggl
with

chang
from
beauti
to
lizard
to
giant
cockroach
and
back
again
,
all
while
try
to
understand
her
own
place
in
the
cosmo
.

she
seem
oddli
knowledg
about
human
societi
,
with
glare
gap
where
her
social
skill
should
be
.

her
instinct
ar
to

and
procreat
,
and
some
of
the

with
her
attempt
in
thi
area

the

elicit
from

rest
of

disappoint
and
bland
,
and
it
is
appar
that
the

wa
a
bit
weak
.

h.r.
giger
's
design
for
the
main
form
of

is
actual
a
bit
bore
when
we
final
get
to
see
it
,
although
previou

the
main
fault
of

is
lack
of
origin

it
start
out
with
a
wonder
,
albeit
borrow
,
premis
,
and
then
doe
n't
live
up
to
it
.

all
we
get
ar
chase
scene
and
a
few
nice
sex
scene
,
with
a
few
monster
toss
in
.

there
is
no
buildup
of
tension
and
suspens
,
no
climax
worthi
of
the
name
;
speci
is
just
a
sequenc
of
``

scene
stuck
togeth

the
movi
is
carri
by
it
chase
and
sex
scene
,
but
not
rescu
by
them
.

on
the
