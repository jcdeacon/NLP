mani
peopl
dislik
french
film
for
their
lack
of
closur
.

while
possibl
shallow
,
i
've
often
had
a
desir
for
a
sens
of
epiphani
,
or
at
least
a
resolut
,
in
the
film
which
i
view
.

there
is
no
revel
in
un
coeur
en
hiver
in
the
tradit
;
howev
,
the
film
is
incred
success
in
it
passion
dramat
of
a
passion-deni
protagonist
,
stephan
-lrb-
daniel
auteuil
-rrb-
.

stephan
-lrb-
daniel
auteuil
-rrb-
is
a
master
violin
maker
.

he
is
passionless
about
all
that
which
surround
him
except
hi
craft
and
the
music
which
hi
craft
is
respons
for
produc
.

even
the
relationship
between
he
and
hi
boss
,
maxim
-lrb-
andr
dussolli
-rrb-
is
a
control
,
and
almost
manipul
associ
,
highlight
by
the
fact
that
stephan
permit
maxim
to
win
close
squash
match
.

in
the
begin
of
the
movi
,
stephan
is
a
close
,
solitari
individu
and
the
audienc
is
carefulli
left
to
wonder
about
the
depth
of
emot
behind
thi
enigmat
man
.

camil
kessler
-lrb-
emmanuel
beart
-rrb-
is
a
master
violinist
and
the
new
love
of
maxim
.

maxim
is
so
much
in
love
with
camil
that
he
plan
to
and
doe
leav
hi
wife
.

like
stephan
,
camil
is
outwardli
veri
control
and
reserv
,
sacrif
all
thought
and
emot
to
her
violin
and
the
music
which
emerg
.

when
stephan
and
camil
meet
,
there
is
a
recognit
of
a
bond
by
both
individu
.

howev
,
wherea
camil
submit
to
the
wild
interplai
of
emot
which
she
now
feel
for
stephan
,
stephan
onli
admit
that
camil
is
attract
to
him
.

stephan
ignor
hi
feel
for
camil
,
which
the
audienc
can
not
help
but
to
see
is
present
.

as
the
movi
progress
,
the
two
charact
becom
more
and
more
polar
in
their
view
and
emot
for
on
anoth
.

these
two
peopl
,
with
veri
similar
approach
to
life
initi
,
react
to
their
new
circumst
veri
differ
.

stephan
becom
even
more
ration
and
control
,
while
camil
becom
more
tempestu
,
until
she
almost
border
on
suffer
a
nervou
breakdown
due
to
the
inabl
to
consumm
their
relationship
.

howev
,
their
approach
to
each
other
is
perhap
not
surpris
consid
their
vocat
.

the
audienc
is
led
to
believ
that
stephan
mai
have
been
a
geniu
as
a
violinist
as
well
,
due
to
hi
relationship
with
a
master
violin
teacher
.

howev
,
appar
,
he
could
not
be
a
violinist
due
to
hi
intoler
for
flaw
in
hi
plai
.

consequ
,
stephan
becom
a
precis
craftsmen
with
the
instrument
and
no
longer
plai
.

in
contrast
,
camil
had
almost
given
the
violin
,
year
earlier
.

howev
,
with
the
aid
of
her
manag
,
she
ha
progress
to
be
almost
on
of
the
world
's
finest
,
successfulli
submerg
herself
to
her
plai
.

dure
the
cours
of
the
movi
,
we
see
both
charact
evolv
as
thei
struggl
to
meet
the
challeng
of
their
new
emot
.

stephan
attempt
to
remain
unchang
.

howev
,
we
do
see
subtl
hint
of
hi
transform
.

on
of
the
most
obviou
is
when
he
defeat
maxim
in
squash
.

the
develop
of
all
of
the
charact
,
mani
of
which
is
not
includ
in
thi
synopsi
,
is
incred
.

american
movi
,
with
rare
except
,
have
not
and
i
would
daresai
can
not
approach
foreign
film
in
charact
develop
.

in
it
essenc
,
thi
movi
is
about
the
develop
and
growth
of
the
charact
,
camil
and
stephan
.

the
portray
of
all
the
other
charact
in
the
movi
,
includ
a
death
,
is
to
further
the
develop
of
camil
's
and
stepahn
's
charact
.

i
am
not
sure
why
berardinelli
sai
,
``
at
time
it
becom
difficult
to
determin
whether
stephan
should
be
piti
or
vilifi
,
and
it
is
to
auteuil
's
credit
that
he
manag
to
maintain
thi
uncertainti
.
''

thi
movi
is
not
about
judg
stephan
's
action
as
be
right
or
wrong
,
but
about
view
their
growth
and
accept
the
charact
as
who
thei
ar
.

i
find
the
end
appropri
;
unfortun
,
i
found
the
last
ten
minut
which
led
up
to
the
final
scene
to
be
veri
unfulfil
.

thi
portion
of
the
film
is
where
the
``
sens
of
closur
''
could
have
been
successfulli
accomplish
.

unfortun
,
there
is
a
hurri
and
almost
a
soap
opera-type
surg
of
emot
from
all
of
the
charact
.

while
ravel
mai
not
be
quit
as
accomplish
as
schubert
or
mozart
,
ravel
ha
hi
dai
in
thi
film
.

the
synerg
of
the
tension
of
ravel
's
music
and
tension
on
the
screen
is
the
best
i
have
ever
seen
.

the
direct
in
thi
movi
is
wonder
.

the
actor
and
actress
ar
excel
,
each
plai
their
part
with
great
sincer
and
warmth
.

emmanuel
beart
's
person
is
beauti
.

and
needless
to
sai
,
i
must
sai
that
emmanuel
beart
,
herself
,
is
beauti
.

besid
the
near
end
,
the
onli
other
critic
of
the
movi
which
i
have
is
that
the
movi
is
almost
too
cerebr
.

i
almost
left
with
the
sens
littl
happen
becaus
almost
all
the
chang
which
occur
in
the
movi
happen
in
deep
in
their
psych
and
littl
in
their
person
or
the
situat
which
thei
end
as
part
of
.

the
on
question
which
i
am
left
with
is
while
thei
have
accept
their
lot
,
ha
their
attitud
toward
love
chang
?

i
have
sever
possibl
which
i
believ
the
movi
hint
at
,
but
i
am
unsur
of
which
the
director
is
espous
.

in
summari
,
thi
movi
is
sole
about
the
charact
growth
of
two
charact
who
almost
develop
a
relationship
.

in
the
process
,
we
see
their
attitud
toward
life
and
other
peopl
.

in
itself
,
i
do
not
believ
un
coeur
is
a
complic
movi
.

where
it
doe
becom
complic
is
when
we
juxtapos
the
scene
of
the
movi
into
the
greater
walk
of
life
where
we
,
as
american
,
have
preconceiv
american
notion
of
relationship
,
love
,
and
peopl
.

i
do
wonder
how
the
movi
translat
when
view
within
it
nativ
french
cultur
.

howev
,
i
,
bring
my
american
preconcept
,
enjoi
the
film
.

i
would
welcom
ani
comment
about
thi
movi
from
ani
who
have
seen
it
.
