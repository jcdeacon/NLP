it

obviou
he

the
courag
to
confront
her

as
he
rail
on
about
accomplish
someth
with

and
take
a
stand
,
all
the
while
backped

out
of

.

he
then
flee
the
scene
with
the
grace
of
an
inept

.

erin

to
erin
's
embarrass
horror
,
the
ad
describ
her
as
a
``
friski
,
cultur
,
carefre
profession
with
a
zest
for

''
.

eventu
,
erin
respond
to
the
tidal
wave
of
respons
,
which
make
for
some
of
the
most
humor
,
tell
moment
of
the
movi
as
she
meet
prospect
suitor
and
``

.

alan
,
a
plumber
and
aspir
marin
biologist
,
first

from

to

,
separ
by
the
glass
as
erin
,
oblivi
to
hi

,
enjoi
the
fish
.

later
,
we
see
him
on
a
train
as
she
sit
on
a
platform
outsid
,
mere
feet
awai

a

is
put
on

the
manner

the
film
move
along
at
an
unhurri
pace
,
albeit
too
much
so
in
the
latter
third
,
as
we
wait
for
the
two
to
meet
.

co-writer
anderson
and
lyn
vau
throw
a
coupl
of
possibl
red
her
into
the
mix
as
the
two
find
other
possibl
relationship
.

the
film
shift
into
a
much
slower
gear
as
we
wait
for
these
romanc
to
blow
over
.

when
alan
and
erin
eventu
do
meet
,
we
see
that
perhap
thei
both
were
destin
for
each
other
as
thei
share
a
linger
,
almost
sublimin
know
,
gaze
.

it
's
a
sweet
,
measur
moment
.

the
disappoint
come
in
the
fact
that
we
've
come
to
know
the
pair
,
yet
we
do
n't
get
to
view
their
impend
romanc
.

the
film
's
inher
belief
in
the
subtl
persist
of
fate
and
the
wonder
it
can
bring
to
on
's
life
make
``
next
stop
wonderland
''
a
quiet
pleasur
in
a
cinemat
landscap
litter
with
explos
,
shallow
charact
and
overdon
special
effect
.
