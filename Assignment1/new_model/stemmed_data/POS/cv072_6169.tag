i

not
so
sure
if
hi

deserv
of

but
for
what
it
's
worth

it
deliv

the

especi
work
well
in

case
,
for
the
stori
is
so
preposter
that
the
laugh
help
to
keep

from
take
thing
too
serious
.

but
there
's
no
argument
that
the
more
unbeliev
sequenc
ar
origin
and
entertain
as

:
who
can
resist
the
sight
of
davi
toss
her
daughter
from
a

in
her
hous
into
the
nearbi
treehous
or
chase
after
a
car
...
while
ic

jackson
and
davi
make
a
good
team
.

jackson
is
funni
as
ever
as
ever
;
in
fact
,
hi
spirit
line
deliveri
,
especi
when
he
first
appear
,
ar
more
than
reminisc
of
hi
work
as
jule
in
pulp
fiction
.

as
good
as
he
is
,
the
on
who
should
benefit
the
most
from
thi
project
is
davi
,
who
show
much
promis
as
an
action
heroin
.

what
make
her
so
effect
and
why
she
should
succe
where
streep
and
lee
fail
is
that
she
doe
n't
take
herself
too
serious
.

she
is
obvious
in
on
the
joke
,
slyli
take
jab
at
herself
and
at
the
situat
.

thi
is
not
to
sai
that
she
doe
n't
need
work
--
sometim
she
lai
on
the
``
tough
''
a
bit
too
thick
and
come
off
too
much
as
a
caricatur
.

but
should
the
public
embrac
the
film
and
,
in
turn
,
the
notion
of
a
kick-ass
femal
,
davi
could
have
found
her
special
nich
.

it
seem
as
if
davi

harlin
's
first

the

wa
just

a

for
long

,
in
which
the
wife-husband
team
hit
their

anyon
simpli
look
for
a
