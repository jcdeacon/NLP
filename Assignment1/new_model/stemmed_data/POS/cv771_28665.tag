where
``
thirteen

''
differ
most
from
``
missil
of
octob
''
is
,
as
expect
,
in
the
scope
of
the
project
.

there
is
a
big
differ
,
budget-wise
,
between
make
a
televis
docudrama
and
on
that
goe
to
the
big
screen
.

it
show
as
the
maker
of
``
thirteen

''
craft
a
recreat
of
the
cuban
missil
crisi
that
encompass
not
onli
the
polit
intrigu
within
the
white
hous
,
it
also
depict
the
event
that
took
place
as
america
gird
itself
for
nuclear
confront
.

the
cast
,
a
true
ensembl
,
is
led
,
surprisingli
,
by
bruce
greenwood
as
jfk
and
not
by
kevin
costner
.

costner
's
o'donnel
repres
the
famili
gui
thing
as
the
drama
of
the
crisi
ha
it
impact
on
him
and
hi
famili
.

thi
put
a
person
spin
on
the
film
as
we
see
both
the
crisi
and
america
's
prepar
for
war
and
the
pressur
it
bring
to
bear
on
those
in
the
know
.

kenni
reassur
hi
wife
and
kid
that
all
will
be
okai
and
thei
will
be
safe
,
but
he
know
that
,
if
the
crisi
come
to
a
head
,
hi
famili
will
be
no
more
.

the
meat
of
``
thirteen
dai
''
is
in
the
big
pictur
,
not
the
microcosm
of
famili
,
though
.

thi
is
where
the
film
stand
out
as
we
see
the
work
of
our

the
highest
level
.

the
stori

not
just
cover
the
face-off
between
the
world
's
two
most
power
countri
;
it
also
depict
the
animos
between
the

the

left
a

in
the
mouth
of

expatri
fight
fidel

.

the
missil
crisi
becom
a
struggl
for

as
the

want
to
flex
their

and
invad

thi
is
where

when
the
first

is
palpabl

the
