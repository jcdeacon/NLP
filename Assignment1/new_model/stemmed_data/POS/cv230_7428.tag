well
,
i
'll
admit
when
i
first
heard
about
thi
film
-lrb-
which
wa
befor
dant
's
peak
-rrb-
i
could
just
smell
what
`
twister
'
had
start
.

so
now
it
seem
that
we
're
in
a
full
fledg
return
to
the
'
70
's
disast
film
era
.

with
`
twister
'
,
`
dant
's
peak
'
,
`
volcano
'
and
soon
`
flood
'
and
jame
cameron
's
extremli
expens
`
titan
'
i
'll
sai
first
off
i
enjoi
`
volcano
'
much
more
than
i
did
`
dant
peak
'
.

part
of
that
is
just
be
bias
as
i
usual
enjoi
anyth
that
tommi
lee
jone
appear
in
.

i
've
been
read
a
lot
about

be
`
cheezi
'
or
`
hokei
'
and
realli
did
n't
see
or
think
that
onc
dure
the
entir
film
.

i
get
bore
easili
and
thi
film
did
n't
bore
me
for
a
minut
.

anoth
thing
,
and
boi
am
i
bitch
todai
!

,
that
bother
me
is
when
critic
and
such
go
on
about
``
well
that
not
realli
possibl
.
''

?

i
could
n't
give
a
bloodi
damn
if
it
's
possibl
or
not
,
realli
i
could
n't
.

it
's
a
freak
movi
and
i
do
n't
want
realiti
thrown
in
my
face
.

i
want
to
be
abl
to
see
the
imposs
,
the
all
might
``

if
''
to
mani
review
have
seen
on
