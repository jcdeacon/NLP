what
's
wors
than

how
about
a
fulli
digit
futur
where
noth
is
real
?

that
's
what
comput
programm
neo
-lrb-
keanu
reev
-rrb-
slowli
learn
as
he
enter
the
danger
world
that
is
the
matrix
,
a
movi
direct
by
the
wachowski
brother
-lrb-
the
gui
behind
the
hip
thriller
bound
-rrb-
.

befor
you
groan
at
the
presenc
of
reev
in
the
lead
role
,
hold
on
.

there
's
actual
a
stori
with
depth
here
.

it
seem
that
a
group
of
hacker
is
out
to
stop
the
system
that
is
the
matrix
,
led
by
the
bald
but
brilliant
laurenc
fishburn
and
assist
by
carri
ann
moss
,
who
look
quit
cool
in
leather
,
i
must
sai
.

neo
-lrb-
reev
-rrb-
is
pretti
much
a
kei
player
in
thi
fight
,
although
he
realli
doe
n't
look
it
at
first
.

could
thi
amateur
be
``
the
on
''
as
fisburn
think
he
is
?

credit
the
wachowski
for
put
togeth
a
great
stori
that
allow
suspens
to
build
,
someth
that
few
special
effect-laden
film
seem
to
do
these
dai
.

there
's
plenti
of
effect
to
go
around
,
of
cours
,
but
at
least
there
's
a
backbon
to
build
them
on
as
well
.

reev
is
surprisingli
good
in
hi
role
as
neo
,
particularli
in
a
fight
scene
with
fishburn
that
come
across
as
goofi
,
yet
great
.

i
wish
the
villain
were
n't
quit
so
``

-lrb-
leftov
g-men
from

for
a
sweet
sci-fi
action
with
plenti
of
stop-motion
swoop
camera
angl
and
,
of
cours
,
a
motherlod
of

now
the

bring
