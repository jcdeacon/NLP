with

how
can

not
agre
?

by
itself
,
thi
premis
might
have
been
interest
enough
to
carri
the

.

howev
,
we
ar
also
introduc
to
a
number
of
doubl
cross
which
make
us
pai
attent
and
think
.

jacki
claim
to
be
bring
the
monei
in
for
ordel
,
but
she
's
also
make
a
deal
with
the
fed
as
well
as
with
max
.

the
film
throw
us
off
everi
onc
in
a
while
by
lead
us
to
believ
the
deal
we
thought
wa
authent
is
actual
a
sham
,
but
it
is
in
no
wai
done
to
the
extent
that
we
feel
jerk
around
.

instead
,
it
's
actual
a
nice
departur
from
the
predict
which
is
preval
in
so
mani
of
todai
's
movi
.

at
least
thi
film
ha
a
littl
imagin
.

most
of
the
perform
in
jacki
brown
ar
abov
par
.

pam
grier
,
of
whom
i
had
never
taken
notic
befor
,
plai
jacki
with
a
mix
of
confid
and
vulner
which
make
her
charact
believ
.

samuel
l.
jackson
ha
a
kind
of
mesmer
qualiti
about
him
as
he
handl
himself
in
situat
where
you
know
he
is
in
total
control
.

robert
forster
is
thoroughli
likabl
becaus
he
come
across
as
such
an
honest
gui
,
try
to
do
hi
best
.
.

never
mind
that
he
belong
to
a
profess
where
sneak
into
a
gui
's
apart
to
zap
him
with
a
stun
gun
is
simpli
a
matter
of
cours
.

he
's
just
so
down-to-earth
,
the
natur
of
hi
job
realli
doe
n't
occur
to
us
,
even
when
we
're
shown
him
bring
a
handcuf
woman
to
prison
,
or
when
we
see
the
tool
of
hi
trade
.

in
support
role
ar
robert
de
niro
as
loui
gara
,
a
recent
parol
friend
of
ordel
's
,
and
bridget
fonda
as
melani
,
on
of
the
girl
ordel
keep
around
town
.

unfortun
,
de
niro
is
basic
wast
as
hi
line
ar
few
and
far
between
,
and
then
thei
ar
mostli
clip
sentenc
.

in
thi
film
,
he
's
not
realli
de
niro
,
but
stereotyp
de
niro
,
utter
thing
like
,
``
littl
bit
,
''
and
``
pretti
much
.
''

fonda
,
on
the
other
hand
,
plai
the
slightli
space-out
melani
with
satisfactori
relish
and
cute
,
such
that
even
when
she
is
annoi
loui
,
we
ar
take
her
side
.

as
is
characterist
of
ani
film
in
which
tarantino
ha
had
a
hand
,
the
dialog
is
quick
and
snappi
.

it
grab
our
attent
and
is
actual
interest
,
and
in
mani
respect
,
thi
make
jacki
brown
a
film
which
need
few
visual
;
the
line
ar
a
form
of
art
in
and
amongst
themselv
.

do
n't
count
tarantino
out
when
it
come
to
us
the
camera
,
howev
.

there
's
a
scene
where
max
is
unwittingli
watch
a
dry
run
of
a
monei
exchang
,
and
he
's
not
realli
sure
what
's
happen
,
but
by
compos
the
scene
just
so
,
hi
realiz
of
what
's
go
on
is
felt
simultan
by
the
audienc
.

we
look
at
the
screen
and
think
,
``
gee
,
that
's
clever
,
''
and
then
think
the
same
thing
about
how
the
film
induc
us
into
that
wonder
feel
of
catch
on
.

although
tarantino
is
n't
afraid
to
drag
out
a
shot
for
dramat
effect
,
it
unfortun
work
to
vari
degre
in
thi
film
.

there
ar
shot
where
a
charact
is
simpli
drive
,
and
we
watch
thi
person
and
somehow
get
an
idea
of
what
is
go
on
in
hi
or
her
head
.

thi
is
a
tribut
to
both
direct
and
act
.

howev
,
there
is
at
least
on
other
scene
where
we
follow
jacki
through
a
mall
,
and
she
is
look
for
someth
;
desper
look
for
someth
.

we
get
the
idea
of
the
frantic
natur
of
her
search
,
but
we
follow
her
for
so
long
that
we
end
up
not
realli
care
about
what
she
's
look
for
,
but
instead
hope
she
'll
just
stop
.

overal
,
view
jacki
brown
is
time
spent
well
.

some
flap
ha
alreadi
been
made
about
the
languag
us
in
the
film
,
but
it
's
realli
not
much
wors
than
mani
of
the
other
movi
out
there
todai
.

in
fact
,
on
might
even
be
abl
to
sai
that
the
wai
in
which
these
``
offens
''
word
ar
emploi
almost
caus
them
to
parodi
themselv
and
therefor
transcend
their
own
offens
.

go
see
the
film
and
see
what
i
mean
.
