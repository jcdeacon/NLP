a

the

month
were
treacher
to
their

and
research
as
thei

all
that
chang
when
on

she
caught
an

the

she

at

a

the
depth

from

it
is
obviou
that
the

thei
were
world
apart
in
almost
all
aspect
,
foster
be
a

the
meet
of
their
world
,
ad
with
the
situat
which
thei
ar
put
into
make
the
entir
storytel
process
near
flawless
.

mani
peopl
who
read
the
synopsi
of
thi
film
would
find
it
a
tad
too
ridicul
,
but
by
actual
immers
yourself
in
it
,
give
you
an
entir
differ
perspect
;
on
which
is
free
from
bia
and
pre-concept
.

zemecki
and
hi
team
of
screen
writer
have
done
a
remark
job
in
tell
thi
tale
through

.

contact
work
by
not
delv
in
controversi
but
rather
,
touch
the
think
audienc
,
urg
them
to
ponder
upon
the
question
rais
in
the
film
concern
fact
and
faith
;
whether

can
actual
find
compromis

i
consid
contact
