take
it
sweet
time
to
tell
a
small
,
intim
stori
.

it
's
a
quiet
film
,
a
slow
film
,
a
deliber
film
.

but
if
you
're
patient
with
it
,
the
movi
offer
innumer
reward
,
such
as
a
pair
of
self-assur
perform
by

the

.

in

,
the

in
the
tradit
sens
;
it
doe
n't
present
a
linear
stori

drive
miss
daisi
is
a
movi
about
human
natur
,
ag
,
prejudic
,
and
a
great
mani
other
thing
,
but
more
than
anyth
it
's
about
a
relationship
:
on
that
span
25
year
,
4
car
,
the
advent
of
civil
right
,
and
on
grave
import
33
cent
can
of
salmon
.

daisi
is
strong-will
and
set
in
her
wai
,
and
,
from
the
outset
,
she
is
utterli
oppos
to
the
idea
of
have
a
chauffeur
.

initi
,
she
treat
hoke
with
contempt
,
refus
to
let
him
drive
her
anywher
.

onc
she
doe
get
in
the
car
,
daisi
is
the
ultim
back-seat
driver
.

to
make
matter
wors
,
she
is
extrem
self-consciou
about
what
other
might
think
if
thei
were
to
see
her
be
escort
around
town
by
a
hire
hand
.

eventu
,
howev
,
daisi
is
worn
down
by
hoke
's
good-natur
charm
and
infecti
cheer
;
she
soften
and
open
up
to
him
.

tandi
plai
the
part
of
daisi
exceedingli
well
,
but
unfortun
thi
feisti
,
cantanker
charact
is
just
a
smidgen
too
commonplac
.

we
've
seen
thi
woman
countless
time
befor
in
other
incarn
,
from
on
golden
pond
to
cocoon
.

nevertheless
,
tandi
manag
to
put
enough
of
a
person
stamp
on
the
familiar
charact
to
make
it
her
own
.

freeman
,
as
hoke
,
on
the
other
hand
,
give
the
more
distinct
of
the
two
perform
.

there
is
someth
profoundli
move
about
the
wai
hoke
maintain
hi
pride
and
digniti
in
a
societi
which
forbid
him
from
us
public
rest
room
becaus
of
hi
skin
color
.

hoke
is
uneduc
and
illiter
,
but
freeman
alwai
suggest
that
there
is
someth
more
to
thi
man
,
an
inner
strength
beneath
the
simpleton
exterior
.

both
freeman
and
tandi
seem
to
be
in
their
element
,
in
full
command
of
their
natur
charisma
.

thei
flirt
with
the
camera
and
domin
scene
without
overtli
call
attent
to
themselv
.

thei
bring
a
light
touch
to
their
humor
banter
and
to
the
movi
's
gentl
humor
.

at
the
same
time
,
tandi
and
freeman
provid
more
than
a
few

of
truli
poignant
