my
summer
wa
recent
save
by
two
veri
differ
movi
.

on
open
night
,
i
saw
american
pieand
laugh
like
a
moron
.

then
a
few
night
later
,
i
watch
and
thoroughli
enjoi
joel
hershman
's
greenfing
even
though
it
did
n't
featur
a
trip
to
band
camp
,
girl-on-girl
action
,
or
seann
william
scott
.

howev
,
i
felt
just
as
good
leav
american
piea
i
did
after
leav
greenfing
,
which
tell
the
offbeat
tale
of
british
murder
colin
brigg
-lrb-
clive
owen
of
croupier
-rrb-
.

after
spend
roughli
half
of
hi
life
behind
bar
,
he
is
transfer
to
a
more
lenient
facil
,
edgefield
.

the
picaresqu
,
rustic
prison
allow
it
inmat
to
learn
a
trade
,
while
enjoi
accommod
gener
found
at
most
colleg
.

at
first
,
brigg
doe
n't
want
to
be
there
.

he
's
us
to
live
as
a
prison
and
want
to
be
left
alon
.

howev
,
hi
ail
roommat
,
fergu
-lrb-
david
kelli
of
wake
ned
devin
-rrb-
,
wear
brigg
down
through
hi
benign
natur
.

the
two
becom
friend
,
with
fergu
give
colin
a
packet
of
violet
seed
as
a
christma
gift
.

brigg
is
astonish
when
the
violet
grow
in
the
limeston
soil
,
and
begin
a
fight
with
three
other
prison
when
an
errant
soccer
ball
smash
hi
belov
flower
.

after
the
prison
's
governor
-lrb-
warren
clark
-rrb-
reprimand
them
,
he
's
aw
at
what
brigg
ha
accomplish
.

and
he
's
struck
by
an
idea
--
brigg
,
fergu
and
the
other
men
will
grow
a
garden
on
the
prison
's
ground
.

greenfing
,
which
is
``
inspir
by
actual
event
,
''
becom
a
bit
like
a
sport
movi
after
that
.

despit
their
differ
,
the
men
come
togeth
and
through
hard
work
and
love
earn
a
spot
at
the
big
game
--
in
thi
case
a
prestigi
garden
show
.

on
renegad
,
in
thi
case
,
brigg
,
will
prove
to
have
talent
.

of
cours
,
love
will
also
rear
it
head
-lrb-
no
,
not
``
prison
love
''
-rrb-
.

to
hershman
's
credit
,
he
doe
n't
pump
up
the
drama
or
try
for
cheap
laugh
,
like
last
year
's
lame
marijuana
comedi
save
grace
.

i
had
to
keep
pinch
myself
when
i
did
n't
see
a
singl
scene
of
a
harden
con
sneez
over
a
pot
of
pansi
,
or
the
men
give
high-five
over
a
particularli
stun
batch
of
wildflow
.

the
movi
deal
with
peopl
and
score
on
that
concept
.

it
's
wonder
see
brigg
turn
from
a
bitter
prison
to
a
man
who
care
again
.

give
credit
to
owen
for
keep
hi
cool
in
a
part
that
beg
for
overact
.

hi
speech
to
the
parol
board
about
be
reborn
through
garden
is
the
best
scene
of
it
kind
sinc
morgan
freeman
's
last
stand
in
the
shawshank
redempt
.

owen
's
bedsid
scene
with
kelli
,
who
lend
the
film
a
human
touch
,
ar
a
marvel
to
behold
,
emotion
grip
without
be
sappi
.

written
by
hershman
,
greenfing
contain
plenti
of
laugh
.

most
come
courtesi
of
helen
mirren
,
who
shine
as
the
world-class
garden
who
work
with
the
inmat
but
fear
for
her
daughter
primros
-lrb-
natasha
littl
-rrb-
when
she
start
date
brigg
.

the
mother
ca
n't
believ
what
he
'll
do
if
her
daughter
``
burn
the
sundai
roast
.
''

noth
is
forc
in
greenfing
.

the
funni
line
come
forth
natur
in
convers
and
not
from
punch
line
.

primros
and
brigg
'
relationship
take
awkward
step
.

even
when
brigg
decid
to
go
back
to
edgefield
,
it
's
done
for
reason
of
loyalti
,
not
becaus
the
movi
requir
him
to
do
so
.

after
grimac
through
the
forc
screwbal
antic
of
movi
like
america
's
sweetheart
and
the
princess
dairi
,
it
's
an
almost
indescrib
pleasur
to
see
a
director
take
hi
time
to
tell
a
stori
veri
well
.
