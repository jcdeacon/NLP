which
is
a

as
thi
is
a
fine

.

for
those
who
have
yet
to
view
the

,
let
me
sai
that
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
portrai
the
nightmarish
realiti
of

as

''

in
my
view
,
if
thi
film
is
to
be
compar

it
would
have
to
be

problemat

the

seem

by

the

for
those
in

,
might
i
suggest
closer
scrutini
of
the
bell

at
the

as

-lrb-
bill
pullam
-rrb-
and
hi
thai-born

a
recur
element
of
the
movi
is
the
tension
between
appear
and
realiti
as
express
in
on
of
the
film
's
tag
line
,
``
who
do

''
and
hank
is
no
except
although
season
movi-goer
and
those
familiar
with
pullman
's
oeuvr
will
find
few
surpris
.

much
of
the
remaind
of
the
movi
is
a
smorgasbord
of
intrigu

incomplet

in
short-hand
fashion
.

lou

who
,
while

be

withhold
vital

crucial
moment
.

is
he
part
of
a
wider

with
an

,
if
somewhat

,
the
film
offer
by

a
rivet
courtroom

,
a

,
and
a
potenti
charact
studi
of
american
teen
,
their
relationship
,
and
what
constitut

the
result
is

if
``

ha
a
major

it
is

it

thailand
's
cultur
,
contrari
to
most
opinion
,
come
off
much
better
by
comparison
.

it
amaz
me
that
review
argu
thi
point
at
both
extrem
.

i
believ
the
filmmak
's
view
wa
that
thai
cultur
is
vastli
differ
from
the
american
but
not
necessarili
inferior
.

the
thai
-lrb-
with
the
sole
except
of
a
corrupt
offici
and
a
spite
prison
spy
-rrb-
were
uniformli
consist
in
their
behavior
and
true
to
their
principl
.

the

were
shown
to
be
treat
no
better
but
certainli
no
wors
than
the
nativ-born
.

their
prison
-lrb-
in
stark
contrast
to
the
probabl
realiti
-rrb-
wa
no
hellhol
,
be
rel
clean
and
sunlit
.

the

,
provid
medic
care
when
need
,
and
``
hard
manual
labor
''
consist
of
pick
grass
!

the
thai
guard
were
authoritarian
-lrb-
what
els
?
-rrb-

but
certainli
not
routin
sadist
.

as
for
the
thai
justic
system
,
the
reason
of
the
thai
judg
,
dure
both
an
appeal
hear
and
in
the
film
's
penultim
scene
wa
devast
in
it
logic
and
moral
.

`
freedom
'
ha
mani
face
and
``
brokedown
palac
''
explor
mani
of
them
.

in
the
extrem
,
we
have
freedom
of
the
bodi
and
freedom
of
the
spirit
.

some
settl
for
the
former
alon
while
other
remain
imprison
with
an
entir
nation
to
roam
without
the
latter
.

but
freedom
seldom
come
without
a
price
.

which
is
why
the
movi
's
other
tag
line
ar
:
``
what
is
your
dream
?
''

and
``
how
far
would
you
go
?
''

i
believ
i
could
make
a
good
case
for
the
interpret
that
the
person
who
attain
freedom
,
incarcer
or
not
,
by
film
's
end
is
alic
.

she
find
redempt
and
salvat
through
the
accept
of
person
respons
.

i
think
the
light
bath
onli
her
figur
among
the
assembl
prison
in
the
final
scene
visual
signal
that
fact
.

kate
beckinsal
's
charact
might
more
properli
be
liken
to
the
``
releas
''
templ
bird
refer
to
twice
dure
the
film
,
``
train
to
fly
back
to
it
cage
.
''

as
the
thai
magistr
observ
in
the
film
's
climact
scene
,
the
issu
wa
alwai
on
of
``
charact
;
''
and
the
jamaican
prison
made
it
clear
that
``
freedom
''
is
achiev
within
oneself
.

if
on
think
back
over
the
movi
,
which
charact
wa
transform
by
their
experi
?

increasingli
,
the
cinema
landscap
seem
to
have
becom
litter
with
endless
permut
of
`
kung
fu
woman
'
--
femal
charact
virtual
indistinguish
from
male
action
figur
.

here
,
at
last
,
is
the
stori
of
a
modern
heroin
.

in
read
the
mani
user
's
comment
,
i
wa
struck
by
what
seem
an
unusu
phenomenon
:
whether
or
not
a
person
like
the
movi
,
almost
everyon
prais
the
actor
.

think
about
that
.

when
wa
the
last
time
you
came
awai
from
a
motion
pictur
possibl
hate
it
,
but
rave
about
all
the
perform
in
it
?

do
yourself
a
favor
:
rent
``
brokedown
palac
''
and
watch
it
with
a
open
mind
.

there
's
more
there
than
meet
the
