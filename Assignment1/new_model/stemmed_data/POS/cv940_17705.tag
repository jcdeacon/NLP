when
i
first
saw
the
preview
for
ron
howard
's
latest
film
,
my
expect
were
discouragingli
low
.

a
show
about
noth
?

sound
like
``
seinfeld
.
''

a
gui
whose
entir
life
is
broadcasthour
a
dai
?

sound
like
``
the
truman
show
.
''

what
is
it
with
hollywood
that
no
sooner
than
on
product
compani
put
out
an
anim
featur
about
ant
,
anoth
put
on
out
about
bug
?

which
is
why
i
wa
pleasantli
surpris
by
``
edtv
,
''
which
turn
out
to
be
a
fresh
,
insight
,
and
often
time
hilari
film
about
the
folli
of
instant
celebr
.

the
write
,
by
howard
's
longtim
collabor
lowel
ganz
and
babaloo
mandel
,
is
right
on
the
monei
and
howard
himself
should
be
credit
for
give
the
subject
matter
a
fresh
focu
.

in
the
hand
of
a
less-experienc
director
,
``
edtv
''
could
easili
have
had
all
the
flavor
of
yesterdai

meatloaf

up
with
the
idea
of
put
a
nobodi
on

air
and
broadcast
hi

the
hook
is
to
find

while

but
on
watch
the

,
the
show

more
taken
with

with

he
's
cute
,
he
sai
all
the
wrong

,
and
he
's
100
%

cynthia
's
boss
,
plai
by
rob
reiner
,
give
the
show
a
week
to
deliv
the
good
and
it
's
tough
go
in
the
earli
stage
.

the
most
excit
thing
that
happen
is
ed
brush

``

wag
on
of
the
product
assist
when
a
coupl
of
pop
tart
jump
out
of
the
toaster
.

you
get
the
idea
.

but
soon
enough
,
thing
--
nielsen-boost
kind
of
thing
--
start
to
happen
to
thi
unassum
san
francisco
video
store
clerk
and
the
`
true

'
camera
ar
right
there
to
document
it
.

no
longer

hi
newfound

have
a
neg
impact
on
hi
famili
life
,
and
what
littl
digniti
he
ha
left
is
trampl
on
by
the
media
.

who
should
ed
go
out
with
?

you
can
be
sure
the
pollster
have
a
list
.

not
onli
is
the
film
exceedingli
well
cast
,
but
it
perform
ar
consist
excel
.

matthew
mcconaughei
provid
the
face
,
the
bodi
languag
,
and
the
lovabl
texan
accent
to
fill
the
shoe
of
america
's
latest
phenomenon
.

he
and
harrelson
look
like
thei
realli
could
be
brother
.

salli
kirkland
is
noteworthi
in
a
difficult
role
as
ed
's
mother
,
and
martin
landau
is
on
of
the
film
's
highlight
as
al
,
ed
's
ail
stepfath
.

jenna
elfman
-lrb-
from
tv
's
``
dharma
and
greg
''
-rrb-
prove
herself
surprisingli
worthi
in
the
compani
of
kirkland
and
landau
,
although
those
alpin
eyebrow
of
her
get
a
littl
distract
.

even
degener
and
reiner
ar
better
than
you
'd
expect
.

in
1979
,
writer/director/comedian
albert
brook
made
a
zani
littl
film
call
``
real
life
''
in
which
a
small-time
opportunist
make
a
real-time
documentari
about
a
typic
american
famili
.

the
scene
of
ed
's
famili
sit
around
the
dinner
tabl
feast
on
kentucki
fri
chicken
and
wax
idiot
plai
like
a
big-budget
variant
on
that
film
,
parallel
it
wickedli
invent
humor
.

as
with
most
film
by
albert
brook
,
``
real
life
''
wa
funni
,
but
absurd
.

the
funniest
--
and
scariest
--
thing
about
``
edtv
''
is
that
it
is
absolut
believ
.
