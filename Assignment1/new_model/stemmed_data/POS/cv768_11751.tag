will
meet
a
british
medic
school
student
-lrb-
driver
-rrb-
and
thei
begin
to
fall
in
love
.

the
stori
start
out
well
enough
and
is
a
pretti
origin
basi
for
a
film
.

even
though
we
¹
ve
seen
movi
about
misunderstood
,
errat
prodigi
befor
-lrb-
³
shine
²
ring
a
bell
?
-rrb-

,
the
script
here
creat
a
complex
narr
that
doesn
¹
t
just
focu
sole
on
on
charact
.

ala
though
,
thi
is
not
a
perfect
film
,
as
much
as
you
feel
like
it
could
¹
ve
been
while
watch
it
.

the
on
real
problem
i
had
with
it
is
the
unrealist
natur
of
the
main
charact
.

is
it
possibl
for
a
lowli
janitor
to
be
thi
intellig
?

of
cours
.

is
it
possibl
for
him
to
be
estrang
from
ani
deep
,
human
relationship
?

usual
,
ye
.

but
,
is
it
possibl
for
him
to
also
be
so
handsom
,
funni
,
quick
with
the
tongu
,
and
citi-street
tough
?

not
veri
like
.

come
on
,
usual
these
gui
ar
total
nerd
who
can
¹
t
even
bui
their
own
shirt
,
much
less
talk
down
a
harvard
student
in
a
hip
pub
while
pick
up
phone
number
from
pretti
med.-school
girl
.

will
is
just
a
littl
too
perfect
,
and
in
order
to
accept
the
charact
your
disbelief
suspens
need
to
be
in
excel
work
condit
.

the
heavi-hand
,
anti-war
statement
made
by
will
at
a
govern
job
interview
late
in
the
film
is
also
boorish
,
overlong
,
pompou
,
and
complet
unnecessari
.

all
thi
sound
pretti
bad
,
but
the
film
somehow
make
up
for
it
in
other
wai
.

damon
¹
s
act
overshadow
the
fact
that
the
charact
is
slightli
unbeliev
,
hi
perform
is
truli
extraordinari
.

which
lead
me
to
the
realli
good
part
of
the
review
.

the
strength
of
thi
movi
can
be
sum
up
in
on
singl
word
:
act
.

i
can
¹
t
recal
see
a
film
recent
that
wa
so
well-act
from
top
to
bottom
.

from
minni
driver
¹
s
frustrat
lover
to
ben
affleck
¹
s
laid-back
best
friend
,
and
all
the
small
role
in
between
,
the
perform
ar
magnific
.

robin
william
¹
skill
is
a
given
as
a
bereav
psychologist
who
could
¹
ve
had
a
legendari
career
but
wa
knock
off
the
path
somewher
down
the
line
.

the
real
gem
though
is
stellan
skarsgård
¹
s
turn
as
professor
lambeau
,
an
award-win
mathematician
who
feel
reduc
in
comparison
to
a
younger
,
smarter
will
hunt
.

the
scene
between
william
and
skarsgård
,
as
two
old
colleg
pal
who
¹
ve
been
brought
back
togeth
by
thi
enigmat
kid
,
displai
some
of
the
best
act
i
¹
ve
ever
seen
.

when
i
sai
deliv
the
good
,
thi
is
what
i
¹
m
talk
about
.

watch
these
two
work
is
what
go
to
see
movi
is
all
about
.

gu

-rrb-
cold
,
urban
direct
is
right
on
,
as
well
as
danni

¹
s
saunter

.

i
highli
recommend
³
good
will

²
.

despit
it
fault
,
it
is
still
an
intrigu
and
fascin
film
and
you
ar
not
like
to
see
a
better
act
on
thi
year
.
