thi
bring

the
big

,
it
turn
out
to
have
a

the
big
hit
is
quit
the
opposit
.

it
wa
hype
as
``
the
new
film
from
produc
john
woo
''
,
so
on
would
it
expect
lot
of
styliz
kill
and
action
.

howev
,
there
's
a
sore
lack
of
it
,
which
is
about
the
onli
thing
wrong
with
the
big
hit
.

the
film
start
out
with
mel
smilei
and
hi
cohort
do
a
job
on
a
white
slaver
.

mel
,
plai
by
mark

in
a
dopei
,
milquetoast
role
,
is
a
kill
machin
;
he
flip
,
spin
,
even
breakdanc
whilst
pop
cap
.

sadli
,
he
doe
n't
get
a
chanc
to
do
much
of
it
.

except
for
the
begin
set
piec
and
the
lasttwenti
minut
or
so
,
the
film
is
in
comedi
mode
.

the
action
,
at
least
what
there
is
of
it
,
is
prime
cut
stuff
.

wong
,
after
numer
hong
kong
featur
,
make
quit
a
nice
u.s.
debut
.

howev
,
hi
pace
is
a
bit
off
,
with
the
action
sequenc
onli
bookend
the
movi
and
not
last
long
enough
.

thei
start
off
electrifi
and
fresh
,
but
just
kinda
stop
.

normal
,
thi
would
hamper
a
movi
to
the
point
of
be
unenjoy

luckili
,
we
have
ben

a

the
onli
problem
is
there
might
be
too
much
humor
,
on
joke
make
you
laugh
so
hard
you
miss
the
next
few
.
