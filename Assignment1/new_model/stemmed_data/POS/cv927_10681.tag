i
met
outsid

who
had
just
seen
the
film
and
wa
walk
back
in
to
see
it
again

escap

how
hi
father

i
wa
struck

as
grand
as
it
look
and
as
histor
accur
as
it
is
,
there
is
a
distanc
between
the
audienc
and
the
movi
.

the
film
is
more
concern
with
visual
and
histori
and
less
so
with
human
be
.

with
the
except
of
a
few
scene
,
involv
with
the
charact
is
slight
.

on
of
those
except
is
the
portray
of
the
young
dalai
lama
,
shown
as
a
mischiev
boi
who
ca
n't

the
young
leader
the
chines
have
order
him
to
persuad
him
to
accept
communist
rule
or
kill
him
is
an
outstand
moment
,
but
there
ar
n't
mani
of
these
.

even
with
it
problem
,
the
``
kundun
''
experi
is
phenomen
,
but
on
that
i
fear
most
will
miss
.

mani
peopl
who
saw
``

''
will
have
a
``

it
's
like
that
the
film
will
miss
a
wide-spread
appeal

public
respons
will
