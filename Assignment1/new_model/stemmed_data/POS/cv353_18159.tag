with
the
abund
of
trite
,
recycl
movi
in
the
late
'
90s
,
there
is
a
tremend
demand
by
movi
lover
-lrb-
never
mind
movi
critic
-rrb-
for
movi
that
present
the
wide
film
audienc
with
someth
truli
origin
:
perhap
audaci
,
perhap
pure
themat
.

for
the
former
,
you
need
look
no
further
than
director
tom
tykwer
's
incred
german
thriller
run
lola
run
,
a
movi
that
mai
make
some
viewer
need
a
cool
off
period
afterward
.

lola
,
a
contemporari
goth-girl
with
blaze
red
hair
receiv
a
desper
phone
call
from
her
boyfriend
manni
on
dai
.

it
seem
that
becaus
she
wa
late
deliv
someth
he
lost
a
bag
contain
a
hundr
thousand
mark
,
and
if
he
doe
n't
deliv
a
hundr
thousand
mark
within
the
next
twenti
minut
,
he
will
be
kill
.

thi
give
lola
twenti
minut
to
come
up
with
100,000
mark
,
or
her
boyfriend
di
.

so

jog
,
sprint
--
in
hope
that
somehow
,
somewai
,
she
'll
be
abl
to
obtain
the
monei
and
save
a
life
.

>
from
there
,
as
critic
steve
rhode
describ
it
,
run
lola
run
plai
a
bit
like
``
slide
door
on
steroid
.
''

with
a
non-stop
techno
soundtrack
,
wierd
camerawork
,
all
kind
of
insan
zoom
and
a
truli
breakneck
pace
,
anyon
that
is
bore
with
run
lola
run
ha
to
be
smoke
someth
.

inde
,
the
movi
is
often
outrag
excit
,
as
well
as
bitterli
iron
and
subtli
seriou
.

veri
much
like
titan
,
run
lola
run
is
an
achiev
with
filmmak
much
more
than
it
is
an
achiev
in
film
.

the
wai
the
movi
is
made
,
for
pure
visual
style
,
tykwer
's
movi
is
breathtak
-lrb-
liter
,
sometim
-rrb-
.

themat
it
doe
leav
someth
to
be
desir
;
it
toi
around
with
some
intrigu
idea
but
doe
occasion
seem
as
if
there
is
littl
substanc
behind
all
of
the
flash
.

while
you
ar
watch
,
thi
will
not
matter
.

run
a
breezi
81
minut
,
thi
is
on
movi
i
wish
wa
longer
becaus
it
wa
so
damn
good
while
it
last
.

it
is
the
equival
of
a
roller-coaster
in
the
amount
of
thrill
and
fun
that
it
offer
.
