anyon
who
saw
alan
rickman
's
fine-realiz
perform
in
truli
madli
deepli
and
sens
and
sensibl
will
be
unsurpris
that
the
actor-turn-director
is
a
bit
of
a
poet
at
heart
.

howev
,
for
those
who
recal
him
onli
as
the
maniac
villain
of
die
hard
and
robin
hood
:
princ
of
thiev
,
thi
recognit
mai
be
someth
of
a
shock
.

nevertheless
,
``
poetic
''
is
an
excel
term
to
describ
rickman
's
featur
debut
as
a
director
,
the
winter
guest
.

the
film
ha
a
simpl
,
unhurri
rhythm
that
us
all
of
the
avail
element
to
fashion
a
success
whole
.

the
result
is
an
occasion
haunt
,
sometim
magic
,
and
alwai
insight
human
drama
.

the
winter
guest
is
n't
about
resolv
plot
thread
and
advanc
a
stori
line
;
it
's
about
explor
relationship
and
examin
life
in
all
of
it
stage
.

the
winter
guest
doe
not
tell
a
tradit
tale
,
nor
doe
it
ascrib
to
a
convent
narr
structur
there
is
no
real
begin
or
end
.

instead
,
we
ar
given
an
opportun
to
observ
on
dai
in
the
live
of
eight
human
.

thei
repres
both
sex
,
multipl
gener
,
and
a
varieti
of
relationship
male
and
femal
;
young
,
middl-ag
,
and
elderli
;
friend
,
would-be
lover
,
and
kin
.

we
see
expect
fulfil
and
disappoint
,
emot
boundari
erod
,
and
truth
unveil
.

there
is
comedi
and
tragedi
.

most
importantli
,
much
of
what
transpir
dure
the
cours
of
the
winter
guest
will
find
an
echo
in
our
own
live
in
thi
fiction
can
be
found
much
truth
.

the
set
is
small
town
in
scotland
on
the
coldest
dai
of
the
year
.

it
's
so
frigid
that
the
sea
ha
begun
to
freez
over
.

the
onshor
wind
cut
like
a
knife
and
snow
blanket
the
beach
,
give
the
terrain
an
alien
appear
.

it
is
against
thi
backdrop
that
the
relationship
of
the
film
ar
captur
.

there
ar
four
pair
,
and
,
although
there
is
some
interact
between
the
differ
twosom
,
the
winter
guest
's
focu
is
on
the
dynam
intern
to
each
relationship
.

the
first
,
meatiest
pair
is
that
of
elspeth
-lrb-
phylida
law
-rrb-
and
her
recent-widow
daughter
,
franc
-lrb-
emma
thompson
-rrb-
.

these
two
have
a
stormi
relationship
.

thei
love
each
other
deepli
,
but
both
ar
stubborn
and
will
,
and
neither
is
will
to
admit
that
thei
need
the
other
.

much
of
their
interact
is
argument
,
but
,
dure
the
cours
of
a
long
walk
to
the
frozen
shorelin
,
thei
come
to
an
unspoken
understand
of
how
much
each
mean
to
the
other
.

franc

,
alex

on

he

who
ha
secretli

sandra

-rrb-
ar
a
coupl
of
old

who
ar

death
is
a
topic
of
endless
fascin
for
them
,
perhap
becaus
thei
ar
so
close
to
it
,
and
thei
spend
their
spare
time
scan
the
obituari
,
look
for
the
next
funer
or
cremat
in
the
area
.

it
doe
n't
matter
whether
or
not
thei
knew
the
deceas
.

it
's
the
ceremoni
that
thei
're

in

sam

,

a
small
fire
for

,
and
walk
on
the
frozen
water
.

unlik
lili
and
chloe
,
these
two
have
their
entir
live
ahead
of
them
.

thei
ar
young
enough
to
still
believ
in
magic
,
but
old
enough
to
recogn
that
the
process
of
cross
into
adulthood
rob
life
of
the
simpl
joi
that
onli
children
can
experi
.

the
act
is
strong
and
believ
.

the
mixtur
of
veteran
perform
and
first-timer
is
effect
,
with
the
most
success
choic
be
the
cast
of
real-life
mother
and
daughter
phylida
law
and
emma
thompson
in
the
most
promin
role
.

there
is
a
chemistri
in
their
interact
that
would
be
hard
to
replic
with
two
differ
,
non-relat
actor
.

and
,
of
cours
,
the
physic
resembl
make
it
that
much
easier
to
accept
elspeth
and
franc
as
parent
and
child
.

the
winter
guest
began
it
life
as
a
stage
plai
in
1995
,
with
rickman
as
the
director
.

four
of
the
film

the

ha
been
successfulli
open

.

the
rough
,
bleak
scottish
countrysid
becom
as
much
of
a
charact
as
ani
of
the
eight
human
.

in
fact
,
consid
how
import
the
climat
is
to
everi

under
rickman
's
microscop
,
it
could
be
argu
that
thi
is
the

if

the
