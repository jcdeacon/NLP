``
quill
''
is
an
explor
of
the
marqui
de
sade
:
hi
mad
,
hi
cruelti
and
hi
pervers
,
hi
obsess
with
sex
in
ani
form
,
no
matter
how
obscen
.

but
``
quill

also
detail
the
marqui
'
determin
:
to
write
in
spite
of
the
obstacl
put
in
hi
path
,
and
to
propag
hi
word
to
the
mass
.

the
extent
to
which
de
sade
is
will
to
go
to
practis
hi
trade
is
amongst
the
movi
's
most
intrigu
element
,
as
when
de

scribe
a
stori
in
hi
own
blood
,
or
narrat
a
tale
via
of
a
chain
of

ar
stymi
by

the

lust
for
madelein
,
but
it
is
the
wizen
marqui
who
is
abl
to
have
her
.

and
then
there
is
royer-collard
,
a
hypocrit
who
in
truth
is
as
sadist
as
ani
of
the
marqui

motlei
creation
.

rush
is
splendid
as
de

,
utterli
inhabit
the
charact

kaufman

direct
is
fine
,
and
he
is
abl
to
bring
a
sens
of
bizarr
humour
to
the
grim
proceed
.

the
plot
itself
is
rather
mundan
and
plai

unsurprisingli
,

thi
is
virtual
unimport

for

``
