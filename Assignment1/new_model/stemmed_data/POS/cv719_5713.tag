-lrb-
it

it

if
the

it

perhap
becaus
the

pam

is
best
and
most
movingli
present
in
counterpoint
to
the
more

when

of

it

the

that

it

not

some
of

the

come
rather

close
to
make

an

detract

inde
,
as
in
mcnaughton
's
semin
film
henri
:
portrait
of
a

,
it
is
the
avoid
of

of

that

mcnaughton
ha

quiet

coolli
`

method
that
work
far
better
than

.

the
suburb
,
with
their
mile
of
white-fenc
hous
and

mall
,
take
on
a
sens
of
claustrophob
blank
.

in
it
veri

wai
,
thi
make
for
as
haunt
a
backdrop
as
the
wide
open

in

.

while
pam
share
the
yearn
of
malick
's
hero
to
escap
from
ordinari
life
,
chri
take
up
crime
precis
so
that
thei
can
lead
a
`

'
-
their
littl
hous
on
the

is
financ

but
these

constrain

and
even
doom
by

the
limit
of
the

.

pam
's
final
scene
take
place
at
the

of
the

,
where
wild

grow
--
symbol
the
frontier
,
the
outer
limit
of

also
quit

the
