,
relat
a
hilari
comed
approach
which
smooth
out
the
rough
edg
to
chan
's
perform
.

he
work
perfectli
with
the
script
,
and
it
's
quit
like
he
lent
scribe
jim
kouf
a
hand
with
some
of
hi
line
.

almost
essenti
to
the
action
genr
,
the
plot
is
nonexist
.

we
're
quickli
introduc
to
detect
jame
carter
-lrb-
tucker

is
a
maverick
offic
for
the

cut
forward
to
anoth
scene
where
the
daughter
-lrb-
julia
hsu
-rrb-
of
the
american
chines
consul
-lrb-
tzi
ma
-rrb-
is
kidnap
by
a
gang
of
swarthi

the
fbi
is
quick
to
the

but
the

insist
that

the
fbi
resist
,
but
then
request
that
lapd
send
a
man
over
to
babysit
the

detect
.

it
's
here
that
carter
and
lee
hook
up
,
and
the
two
unwittingli
solv
the
case
while
the
fbi
rush
in

up
.

rattner
doe
a
fine
job
of
go
the
extra
mile
to
get
hi
movi
to
move
a
step
up
,
but
it
doe
n't
quit
reach
the
top
tier
of
action-comedi
like
last
year
's
gross
point
blank
.

there
ar
moment
where
the
plot
strai
too
far
off
the
straight
line
it
stick
almost
exclus
to
,
and
if
not
for
the
comed
interact
between
tucker
and
chan
,
thi
might
be
a
major
drawback
.

also
,
some
support
charact
ar
almost
entir
along
for
the
ride
,
and
other
ar
there
simpli
to
look
menac
.

howev
,
none
give
a
standoffish
perform
and
thei
mostli
mesh
into
the
background
.

almost
everi
member
of
the
cast
displai
some
reserv
at
on
point
or
anoth-whether
it
's
tucker
's
tone-down
routin
or
chan
's
tight
rein
on
hi
action
sequenc-and
that
contribut
greatli
to
thi
