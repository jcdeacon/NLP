dure
brian
de

's
crime
epic
scarfac
,
the
radiant
michel
pfeiffer
turn
to
a
rant
al
pacino
and
pop
a
question
that
the
audienc
ha
no
doubt
been
want
to
ask
for
themselv
:
``
ca
n't
you
stop
sai
'
fuck
'
all
the
time
?
''

fuck
good
question
,
that
.

it
mai
not
be
an
honour
that
instil
the
filmmak
with
pride
,
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
oliv
stone
's
script
contain
the
said
expletit
more
time
than
ani
other
film
in
cinema
histori
.

yet
it
would
be
a
shame
if
bad
languag
is
all
de
palma
's
scarfac
is
rememb
for
,
becaus
thi
is
a
damn
fine
gangstar
flick
.

the
overal
structur
is
similar
to
howard
hawk
'
1932
origin
,
but
thi
time
the
scene
ha
switch
to
miami
,
florida
and
our
anti-hero
's
chosen
vice
is
cocain
traffik
.

pacino
,
sport
a
thick
cuban
accent
,
give
on
the
best
perform
of
hi
career
-lrb-
golden
globe
nomin
-rrb-
as
toni
montana
,
a
cuban
refuge
with
a
crimin
past
who
flee
castro
and
come
to
america
to
live
the
american
dream
.

and
live
it
out
he
doe
,
with
lash
of
violenc
,
abus
,
murder
and
the
funni
white
powder
.

from
hi
earliest
job
as
a
drug
runner
for
variou
middlemen
,
toni
montana
make
it
clear
to
everyon
he
meet
that
he
's
not
a
man
to
be
fuck
-lrb-
sorri
-rrb-
.

soon
he
's
the
king
of
the
cocain
heap
,
but
hi
hot
head
and
an
increasingli
out
of
control
drug
addict
prove
hi
undo
.

``
never
do
your
own
stash
''
,
warn
on
charact
earli
in
the
film
.

as
sure
as
night
follow
dai
,
the
emperor
of
miami
eventu
fall
.

writer
oliv
stone
and
director
brian
de
palma
make
an
explos
combin
here
.

stone
's
script
offer
solid
storytel
and
some
fine
charact
develop
.

montana
is
fascin
;
uneduc
but
calcul
,
a
straight
shooter
who
speak
from
the
heart
;
an
ambiti
,
violent
man
yet
on
with
a
conscienc
.

a
man
fierc
protect
of
hi
beauti
20
year
old
sister
,
not
want
her
to
be
suck
into
the
glitzi
,
danger
world
which
he
inhabit
.

pacino
is
dynamit
,
take
to
the
role
with
a
brood
,
bristl
energi
which
in
hi
more
recent
film
ha
often
degener
into
just
simpl
overract
.

pfeiffer
also
regist
strongli
as
the
gangstar
mole
with
no
inner
life
.

onli
onc
doe
toni
express
real
affect
for
her
and
hi
desir
to
have
children
,
and
even
then
you
sens
all
he
realli
want
is
a
regular
screw
and
a
beauti
object
to
show
off
to
hi
friend
,
and
she
's
happi
to
oblig
.

thi
is
n't
as
meati
a
role
for
pfieffer
as
sharon
stone
's
wa
in
casino
,
but
it
an
effect
on
nonetheless
and
she
aquit
herself
well
.

as
director
,
de
palma
set
up
a
number
of
dramat
scene
with
hi
typic
stylist
brauva
.

the
escal
tension
he
creat
in
variou
mob
situat-a
drug
deal
gone
wrong
,
an
assin
attempt-is
often
thrill
,
and
in
thi
respect
he
is
everi
bit
the
equal
of
scores
and
coppola
.

where
he
differ
from
,
sai
,
coppola
's
godfath
trilogi
is
in
hi
overal
treatment
.

coppola
give
hi
crime
saga
an
operat
sweep
,
wherea
in
scarfac
de
palma
opt
for
a
grittier
feel
.

and
it
perfectli
suit
the
materi
.

the
onli
major
botch
is
giorgio
morod
's
mostli
crap
synthesi
score
.

it
's
just
not
right
,
and
unfortun
compromis
the
impact
of
some
otherwis
good
scene
.

as
expect
,
scarfac
is
veri
violent
at
time
,
but
you
should
n't
be
watch
gangster
movi
if
that
upset
you
.

at
over
two
and
a
half
hour
in
length
it
's
a
true
epic
,
and
if
you
're
a
fan
of
the
genr
you
'll
love
f**k
-
fill
minut
of
it
.
