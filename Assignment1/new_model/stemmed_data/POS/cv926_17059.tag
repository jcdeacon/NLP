director
sam
raimi
,
of
the
evil
dead
and
darkman
fame
,
ha
made
an
excel
and
thought-provok
film
,
world
awai
from
the
comic
horror
film
which
made
hi
name
.

while
there
ar
a
coupl
of
moment
which
might
remind
on
of
hi
earlier
work
,
raimi
ha
made
an
intellig
and
matur
departur
which
will
hopefulli
be
a
sign
of
even
greater
film
to
come
.

scott
b.
smith
's
screenplai
,
base
on
hi
novel
-lrb-
which
i
have
n't
read
-rrb-
is
a
fine
exampl
of
escal
tension
.

while
it
doe
remind
on
of
danni
boyl
's
shallow
grave
without
the
abund
of
black
humour
,
it
keep
the
drama
that
should
realli
be
a
part
of
such
a
stori
on
moral
,
or
the
lack
thereof
,
found
in
a
film
with
thi
subject
matter
.

alar
kivilo

remind
on
of
joel
and
ethan
coen
's
fargo

with
the
bleak

snowi

doe
well
with

if
there
's
a
flaw
in
the
film
,
it
's
that
it
goe
on
for
just
a
littl
too
long
.

just
when
we
think
that
thei
ar
about
to
wrap
thing
up
,
raimi
and
smith
decid
to
let
the
film
go
on
a
littl
further
.

while
thi
is
n't
realli
a
bad
thing
,
it
did
becom
a
littl

thi
is
an
