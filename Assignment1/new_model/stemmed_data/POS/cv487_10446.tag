what
follow
is
a
shell-game
of
violenc
and
betray
,
all
hing
on
the
ident
of
a
mysteri
villain
call
keyser
soze
.

the
film
is
brilliantli
compact
:
it
the
shortestminut
you
'll
ever
spend
in
a
movi
theater
.

the
cast
is
except
.

palminteri
shine
,
he
is
brutal
honest
,
a
true
cop
,
on
who
is
go
after
the
whole
stori
becaus
it
there
.

byrn
is

hi
serious
is
need
to
supplement
the
hysteria
of
benicio
del
toro
,
who
is
a
riot

fenster

del

is
brilliant
,
hi
line
ar
a
jumbl
mess
,
you
ca
n't
understand
a
word
the
man
sai
,
but
it
sure
is
damn
funni
.

baldwin
is
also
veri
good
,
he
is
care
,
method
,
and
cold
,
a
chill
charact
with
a
nasti
streak
of
hot-blood
sarcasm
.

pollak
is
also
terrif
as
usual
,
a
veri
good
charact
actor
.

howev
,
thi
will
be
forev
known
as
the
film
that
launch
kevin
spacei
.

spacei
is
simpli
breathtak
,
he
is
a
forc
on
screen
,
give
a
magnet
perform
that
jar
the
sens
at
the
end
of
thi
twist
maze
.

spacei
's
perform
will
be
rememb
for
year
,
for
it
is
the
best
of
hi
career
,
it
mai
be
the
best
support
actor
perform
in
the
last
year
.

verbal
kint
is
a
clever
storytel
,
weak
,
oppress
,
and
gleefulli
evil
to
the
bone
,
yet
piti
,
on
who
draw
sympathi
.

the
film
is
a
good
on
,
a
decent
film
until
the
lastminut
.

what
thi
film
boil
down
to
is
the
greatest
end
in
cinemat
histori
,
for
me
at
least
.

the
revel
of
keyser
soze
,
the
close
gunfight
,
it
is
someth
wondrou
.

you
have
to
see
thi
movi
abouttim
to
believ
what
thei
do
.

kudo
to
mcquarri
and
singer
for
give
the
audienc
a
delight
,
fast-pace
,
furious
plot-driven
movi
with
quirki
charact
,
phenomen
act
,
and
some
hilari
moment
stuck
in
the
middl
.

mcquarri
refus
to
believ
the
audienc
is
dumb
.

without
furnish
too
mani
detail
,
he
concoct
hi
stori
and
let
it
run
,
hope
the
audienc
get
it
at
the
end
.

we
do
.

thi
might
just
be
the
finest
cinemat
puzzl
ever
creat
.

kudo
also
to
singer
and
john
ottman
,
who
creat
the
score
.

thei
both
creat
what
is
a
true
film-noir
set
,
carefulli
set
up
thi
intric
puzzl
until
the
final
,
jar
end
.

there
ar
flaw
:
more
question
rais
than
answer
,
lack
of
charact
develop
,
and
no
strong
femal
charact
-lrb-
save
on
-rrb-
.

howev
,
the
plot
,
and
that
stun
end
,
make
up
for
all
the
flaw
and
more
.

if
you
have
n't
seen
the
movi
,
rent
it
.

watch
it
.

then
rewind
the
tape
,
and
watch
it
again
.

trust
me
,
you
'll
be
amaz
.
