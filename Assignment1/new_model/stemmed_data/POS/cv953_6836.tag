and
thi
can
be

from
the

even
befor

get
rid
of

artifact
of
the

process
us
when
the

and
thei
look
_
fantast

.

four
and
a
half

miss
footag
have
been
ad
,
includ
a
scene
with
jabba
the
hutt
that
had
origin
been
shelv
becaus
the
state
of
special

in
1977
simpli
could
n't
do

justic
.

howev
,
much
of
the
ten
million
dollar
that
wa
spent
on
the
star

special

restor
went
into
restor
the
qualiti
of

the

badli
damag
by

and
_
that

,
more
than
the

,
is
where
the
real
valu
of
thi
new

li
.

it
's
realli
true
what
thei
sai
in

commerci
:
star
war
lose
_
so
much
_
on
the
small
screen
.

even
letterbox
doe
n't
make
up
for
the
decreas
in
size
and
definit
.

in
regard
to
the
star
war
special
edit
,
and
to
the
other
two
film
of
the
trilogi
which
have
yet
to
be
releas
,
i
'll
make
thi
final
recommend
:
go
and
see
it
.

go
and
see
it
more
than
onc
...
it
mai
be
anoth
twenti
year
befor
it
come
back
to
the
big
screen
after
it
's
gone
thi
time
.

take
along
the
youngster
who
've
never
had
the
big-screen
star
war
experi
--
you
'll
enjoi
see
it
through
their
ey
as
much
as
thei
will
enjoi
it
for
the
first
time
.

there
's
magic
in
thi
movi
--
special
edit
or
no
,
there
can
be
no
deni
that
it
's
still
star
war
,
and
still
ha
the
power
to
thrill
and
enthral
children
of
all
ag
,
from
four
to
four
hundr
.

let
's
all
return
to
that
time
long
ago
,
and
