plausibl
on

the
panorama
in
which
breakdown
muster
it
's
throb

.

it
is
not
easi
to
cobbl
a

but
breakdown
doe

it
deriv
a
master
,
titil
climax
that
by
it
's
final
,
engross
a
viewer
with
total
absorpt
.

the
plot
is
somewhat
reminisc
of
1988
's
the

driver
who
will
convei
her
to
the
nearest
town
,
where
jeff
will
meet
her
at
a
local
diner
.

it
is
facil
for
the
film
to
turn
into
a
pseudo-suspens
,
but
instead
it
opt
for
maximum
fervor
.

jeff
manag
to
re-start
the
car
himself
,
but
when
he

the
final
climact
period
which

a
huge
truck
,
will
have
you
feel
as
if

it
is
a
pleasur
to
be
part
of
a
classic
confront
of
good
vs
evil
,
and
root
for
the
good
