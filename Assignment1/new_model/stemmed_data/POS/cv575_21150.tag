to

and
husband
,
lead
up
to
some
jaw-drop
twist
that
ar
both
predict
and
not
.

whatev
happen
the
film
wa
excel
to
me
.

i
found
the
write
well-written
as
well
as
the
act
wa
great
.

ashlei
judd
is
such
a
talent
and
beauti
actress
that
she
is
a
hero
in
a
sort
in
thi
movi
.

even
if
you
know
what
is
go
to
happen
in
the
end
,
you
do
n't
know
how
.

thi
is
on
of
those
movi
that
you
realli
do
know
what
is
go
to
happen
,
except
you
do
n't
know
how
thei
ar
go
to
make
it
happen
.

it
could
be
on
wai
or
anoth
,
it
could
be
thi
wai
or
that
wai
.

the
movi
is
highli
styliz
and
extrem
well-made
.

it
get
most
of
it
's
power
from
the
two
lead
:
ashlei
judd
and
tommi
lee
jone
both
give
excel
perform
.

the
charact
ar
well-realiz
and
believ
and
we
feel
libbi
's
pain
when
she
can
not
see
her
child
for
6
year
.

even
though
a
lot
of
critic
did
n't
like
the
film
,
i
love
it
.

the
director
took
hi
time
make
the
movi
,
and
put
a
lot
of
shadow
in
the
movi
.

i
found
it
not
to
be
bore
at
all
and
it
's
onli
flaw
come
from
some
predict
.

it
move
at
a
fast
pace
,
ha
suspens
,
humor
,
heart
and
great
act
.

it
earn
it
's
right
to
be
a
great
movi
and
to
me
that
's
what
it
wa
.
