ladi
and
gentlemen
,
1997
's
independ
dai
is
here
!

it
's
titl
:
starship
trooper
.

and
surprisingli
,
it
is
more
entertain
than
id4
.

i
realiz
that
i
gave
last
year
's
sci-fi
hit
a
4
star
rate
,
but
i
wa
under
the
spell
of
the
power
first
hour
.

after
subsequ
view
,
i
feel
that
independ
dai
realli
wa
n't
as
great
as
it
seem
--
though
i
still
give
it
a
posit
review
.

starship
trooper
,
on
the
other
hand
,
ha
a
mock
sens
of
humor
,
know
perfectli
well
how
ridicul
it
mai
seem
.

as
a
result
,
starship
trooper
is
a
more
excit
,
energet
,
and
live
scienc
fiction
film
.

in
fact
,
i
probabl
could
never
get
tire
of
watch
thi
film
.

starship
trooper
is
veri
reminisci
of
star
war
,
anoth
kick-ass
space
opera
which
reinvent
the
sci-fi
drama
altogeth
.

while
starship
trooper
is
no
star
war
,
it
come
quit
close
,
and
the
easiest
assess
would
be
to
call
thi
film
:
``
the
'
star
war
'
of
the
90s
.
''

am
i
be
to
gener
to
thi
film
?

perhap
,
but
when
a
scienc
fiction
film
come
along
that
can
mix
humor
and
romanc
,
effect
,
into
the
war
race
.

in
essenc
,
thi
is
the
scienc
fiction
equivol
of
pulp
fiction
.

the
easiest
wai
to
write
a
review
of
thi
film
would
be
to
compar
it
to
other
scienc
fiction
film
,
and
i
mai
have
to
.

starship
trooper
is
not
quit
an
origin
film
persai
,
but
director
paul
verhoeven
give
the
film
a
``
kick-the-alien
'
-
ass
''
style
.

id4
had
thi
same
style
,
except
it
wa
forc
,
most
like
the
caus
of
will
smith
have
a
major
role
.

thi
new
``
star
war
''
ha
a
veri
simpl
,
basic
plot
:
mankind
vs.
an
alien
speci
.

the
alien
speci
in
question
here
is
the
bug
,
a
seemingli
advanc
civil
of
arachnid-type
insect
.

howev
,
the
underli
moral
of
starship
trooper
ar
flesh
out
with
deadli
accuraci
.

sometim
the
moral
ar
buri
by
the
bloodi
violenc
and
intens
action
scene
,
but
dure
quiet
moment
,
we
realiz
that
starship
trooper
ha
someth
to
tell
us
about
our
civil
.

more
than
like
,
these
moral
will
be
overpow
and
quickli
forgotten
by
the
time
the
movi
end
.

and
thei
should
be
.

i
doubt
verhoeven
intend
thi
film
to
be
a
thought-provok
film
.

thi
is
an
``
event
''
film
,
but
surprisingli
abov
averag
.

it
is
extrem
refresh
to
watch
a
sci-fi
war
film
,
and
actual
root
for
the
human
side
-lrb-
someth
independ
dai
never
achiev
-rrb-
.

starship

begin
with
a
satir
portray
of
those
strang

refreshingli
origin
.

state
,
``
would
you
like
to
know
more
?
''

,
these
short
new
bulletin
give
the
film
an
immedi
sens
of
humor
,
and
we
know
we
should
not
take
it
serious
.

howev
,
we
also
wit
the
murder
of
sever
trooper
in
battl
,
in
a
gori
,
yet
funni
,
wai
.

after
wit
the
slaughter
,
the
film
jump
back
on
year
,
to
setup
what
we
just
saw
.

we
ar
introduc
to
johnni
rico
-lrb-
casper
van
dien
-rrb-
and
carmen
ibanez
-lrb-
denis
richard
-rrb-
.

rico
flirt
with
carmen
by
send
her
messag
over
comput
termin
in
school
classroom
.

howev
,
carmen
is
n't
as
interest
in
rico
as
she
is
in
becom
a
pilot
.

howev
,
anoth
classmat
,
dizzi
flore
-lrb-
dina
meyer
-rrb-
,
ha
her
ey
on
rico
.

unfortun
,
rico
is
n't
interest
in
dizzi
.

thi
setup
is
rather
clich
,
as
is
the
result
of
the
setup
,
but
it
still
is
fun
to
watch
.

carmen
sign
up
to
becom
a
starship
trooper
,
and
as
a
result
,
rico
sign
up
.

and
as
a
result
,
dizzi
sign
up
.

everyon
is
assign
a
certain
posit
in
the
academi
:
carmen
get
the
pilot
posit
she
want
,
carl
jenkin
-lrb-
neil
patrick
harri
-rrb-
,
a
psychic
,
get
a
posit
in
the
train
program
,
and
rico
is
left
in
the
lowest
class
of
the
starship
trooper
:
the
mobil
infantri
.

the
main
stori
follow
rico
through
hi
trial
and
relationship
.

in
realiti
,
i
found
myself
watch
a
space
version
of
``
melros
place
,
''
but
with
better
special
effect
.

an
hour
into
the
film
,
the
war
begin
.

a
sens
of
tension
grew
in
the
audienc
i
watch
thi
film
with
.

the
first
hour
mai
have
been
a
funni
-lrb-
sometim
unintention
-rrb-
setup
,
but
we
grew
to
care
for
the
flat
charact
,
becaus
no
matter
how
hard
i
tri
not
to
like
the
charact
,
their
gorgeou
look
won
me
over
-lrb-
call
me
superfici
,
if
you
must
-rrb-
.

follow
the
train
session
,
which
had
mani
drama
in
themselv
-lrb-
too
mani
to
mention
here
-rrb-
,
the
trooper
ar
sent
to
war
.

the
bug
live
on
the
planet
klendathu
,
a
planet
which
consist
of
dirt
and
rock
,
and
pretti
much
noth
els
.

mani
drama
occur
dure
the
war
,
until
final
the
trooper
realiz
that
their
is
someth
behind
the
bug
'
attack
.

a
sort
of
intellig
which
mastermind
the
defens
.

the
trooper
ar
order
to
locat
the
``
brain
''
and
captur
it
.

i
hopefulli
left
the
plot
as
vagu
as
possibl
,
becaus
starship
trooper
is
not
about
plot
.

it
's
about
special
effect
and
gori
violenc
.

director
verhoeven
,
most
known
for
hi
nudi
film
showgirl
and
basic
instinct
,
return
to
hi
sci-fi
dai
,
which
gave
us
good
film
like
total
recal
.

verhoeven
like
to
push
the
envelop
of
the
mpaa
,
but
despit
all
the
violenc
,
the
comic
book
feel
give
the
film
a
sens
of
falsehood
.

starship
trooper
is
extrem
violent
,
with
more
gore
than
thi
year
's
event
horizon
.

the
r
rate
is
well
deserv
,
and
hopefulli
parent
will
not
allow
their
12
year
old
children
to
see
it
.

my
guess
is
that
verhoeven
's
target
audienc
is
the
18
to
25
male
group
.

the
film
ha
a
testosteron
level
off
the
chart
,
with
chisel
men
and
beauti
women
.

despit
these
superfici
element
,
starship
trooper
also
creat
a
world
which
made
star
war
so
success
.

while
watch
the
film
,
we
never
second
guess
the
charact
's
decis
becaus
thei
seem
perfectli
clear
.

thankfulli
,
no
hero
is
punch
alien
in
the
face
,
which
give
the
flat
charact
some
depth
for
which
we
can
identifi
with
.

the
cast
of
starship
trooper
is
quit
annoi
to
begin
with
,
but
thei
soon
grow
on
you
.

casper
van
dien
ha
the
chisel
facial
featur
and
tan
skin
which
will
make
most
girl
swoon
.

to
most
gui
,
he
will
come
across
as
artifici
.

fortun
,
van
dien
is
the
worst
of
the
cast
,
despit
how
hard
he
tri
to
come
off
as
a
real
charact
.

dina
meyer
doe
a
much
better
job
of
flesh
out
her
charact
.

her
dizzi
is
extrem
likeabl
.

denis
richard
also
doe
a
good
job
,
and
her
scene
ar
veri
well
done
.

jake
busei
,
gari
busei
's
son
,
give
a
wonderfulli
funni
perform
,
and
provid
on
of
the
biggest
laugh
of
the
film
.

neil
patrick
harri
-lrb-
rememb
,
he
wa
doogi
howser
-rrb-
is
a
littl
wooden
,
and
slightli
out
of
place
with
the
rest
of
the
cast
.

howev
,
he
doe
give
a
good
perform
.

michael
ironsid
give
the
best
perform
of
the
film
as
the
teacher
with
on
arm
.

hi
perform
rise
abov
the
rest
.

perhap
it
is
becaus
hi
charact
is
the
most
develop
,
but
i
think
it
is
just
ironsid
's
presenc
on
screen
.

unfortun
,
no
particular
cast
member
give
a
star-make
perform
,
which
is
too
bad
becaus
the
materi
here
could
have
made
mani
of
the
cast
member
star
.

director
verhoeven
is
the
main
star
of
the
film
.

hi
direct
is
fast
and
unrelentless
.

he
never
slow
down
hi
pace
,
which
make
for
a
wild
ride
.

writer
edward
neumeier
adapt
the
screenplai
from
the
book
by
robert
heinlein
.

the
write
is
usual
veri
funni
,
and
sometim
veri
corni
.

the
dialogu
is
smart
but
not
too
smart
.

we
ar
n't
requir
to
know
everyth
,
but
some
plot
hole
ar
left
unansw
.

thankfulli
we
ar
not
intend
to
notic
,
and
we
realli
do
n't
-lrb-
except
for
on
which
linger
in
my
mind
for
quit
a
while
-rrb-
.

amazingli
,
with
all
the
war
and
romanc
go
on
,
the
screenplai
manag
to
includ
some
surpris
government
issu
.

in
fact
,
these
government
chang
seem
fairli
plausibl
,
and
thi
add
anoth
layer
to
the
stori
.

the
moral
debat
of
the
charact
is
quit
surpris
to
find
in
a
film
of
thi
genr
,
but
what
is
even
more
surpris
is
the
amount
of
humor
includ
into
all
the
carnag
.

i
have
n't
laugh
thi
loud
,
even
in
some
comedi
.

oh
,
and
the
special
effect
ar
first
rate
.

starship
trooper
is
rate
r
for
graphic
sci-fi
violenc
and
gore
,
and
for
some
languag
and
nuditi
.

believ
me
when
i
sai
thi
:
do
n't
take
young
kid
to
see
thi
film
.

it
is
extrem
violent
.

in
fact
,
it
is
probabl
the
most
violent
film
out
thi
year
.

howev
,
if
you
ar
old
enough
-lrb-
over
17
-rrb-
to
see
it
,
starship
trooper
is
guarante
to
entertain
.

it
's
been
a
long
time
sinc
i
have
cheer
for
the
hero
,
while
also
cheer
for
the
bad
gui
.

and
still
,
it
is
my
dream
to
see
a
sci-fi
film
in
which
the
alien
race
destroi
mankind
,
and
take
over
the
world
.

now
that
would
be
entertain
!
