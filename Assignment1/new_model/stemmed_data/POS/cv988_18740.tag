i
wish
i
could
sai
that
there
is
someth
more
to
the
new
star
war
instal
than
what
you
see
in
the
commerci
,
but
there
is
n't
.

georg
luca
is
an
expert
at
craft
triumphant
,
special
effect-bound
flick
and
he
ha
done
it
again
.

thi
is
the
first
star
war
film
i
've
seen
on
the
big
screen
,
so
,
of
cours
,
the
impact
wa
much
greater
than
when
i
watch
the
three
origin
episod
on
video
.

what
is
compel
about
the
phantom
menac
is
not
it
dispos
stori
,
but
it
amaz
visual
.

basic
,
the
film
's
plot
is
center
around
trade
disput
between
two
planet
.

qui-gon
-lrb-
liam
neeson
-rrb-
and
hi
young
apprentic
obi-wan
kenobi
-lrb-
ewan
mcgregor
-rrb-
set
out
with
the
anim
jar-jar
bink
to
fix
the
mess
that
mai
result
in
war
.

when
their
ship
break
down
and
thei
ar
strand
,
thei
find
a
young
boi
,
anakin
skywalk
-lrb-
jake
lloyd
-rrb-
and
hi
slave
mother
.

qui-gon
strongli
believ
that
anakin
is
destin
for
jedi
great
and
immedi
take
him
under
hi
wing
.

anakin
particip
in
a
heart-pound
podrac
,
on
of
the
highlight
of
the
film
,
to
get
the
equip
need
to
fix
qui-gon
's
ship
.

howev
,
most
everyon
is
doubt
about
entrust
the
futur
to
some
unknown
slave
boi
.

meanwhil
,
queen
amadala
-lrb-
natali
portman
-rrb-
is
frustrat
and
at
wit
's
end
,
be
na√Øve
and
young
and
have
so
much
respons
on
her
shoulder
.

there
ar
hardli
ani
emot
scene
in
the
film-even
when
we
discov
that
anakin
will
be
leav
hi
slave
mother
behind
to
begin
jedi
train
,
the
frenzi
excit
of
the
whole
film
wear
down
the
poignanc
to
the
size
of
a
crumb
.

thi
doe
not
prove
that
the
phantom
menac
is
poorli
made
for
it
is
brilliantli
made
.

in
all
the
star
war
film
,
human
emot
that
we
,
the
audienc
,
can
identifi
with
ar
usual
nil
,
but
the
film
ar
for
pure
enjoy
,
not
for
uplift
purpos
.

despit
the
fun
of
watch
the
movi
,
the
phantom
menac
is
not
without
flaw
.

for
starter
,
we
have
the
ill-conceiv
,
moron
charact
jar-jar
bink
who
should
be
consid
a
threat
to
star
war
galact
societi
and
to
the
audienc
.

what
a
klutz
!

georg
luca
clumsili
tri
to
creat
a
fun
charact
that
would
be
as
memor
as
,
sai
,
yoda
,
r2-d2
,
or
c3-po
,
but
,
ala
,
hi
effort
were
in
vain
.

secondli
-lrb-
thi
mai
be
good
or
bad
,
depend
on
your
point
of
view
-rrb-
,
the
movi
's
atmospher
is
so
differ
from
the
familiar
comic-book
feel
of
the
previou
three
star
war
instal
.

thi
is
due
,
perhap
,
to
the
utter
complex
to
thi
movi
's
plot
and
the
higher
level
of
sophist
of
the
visual
effect
us
here
.

the
movi
seem
to
be
reach
for
epic
proport
.

i
ca
n't
sai
much
about
the
act
,
though
act
ha
never
been
what
you
saw
star
war
movi
for
anywai
.

howev
,
there
is
absolut
no
pizzazz
to
the
perform-thei
ar
straightforward
and
,
at
time
,
stale
.

natali
portman
ha
a
great
presenc
,
but
her
turn
as
queen
amadala
make
the
queen
a
stoic
,
unfeel
enigma
.

there
is
noth
we
can
hold
onto
in
her
perform
to
make
us
believ
the
trade
predica
is
anyth
of
import
.

jake
lloyd
is
the
onli
actor
here
who
ha
an
ounc
of
evid
spunk
.

despit
the
inevit
fault
,
there
is
so
much
to
enjoi
about
the
movi
.

the
heighten
excit
of
the
final
sequenc
doe
n't
quit
surpass
the
famou
the
empir
strike
back
climact
scene
,
but
thei
ar
amaz
and
edg-of-your-seat
fun
in
their
own
rite
.

the
film
is
a
treasur
to
look
at
.

the
visual
effect
ar
astonish
99.8
%
of
the
time-the
aw-inspir
,
mouth-open
,
ey-pop
sight
of
the
underwat
citi
is
noth
short
of
product
design
and
special
effect
geniu
.

not
sinc
1997
's
the
fifth
element
ha
there
been
a
film
as
drench
in
visual
treat
as
thi
on
.

the
product
design
is
reminisc
of
the
fifth
element
,
the
previou
star
war
movi
,
kubrick
's
2001
,
mayb
even
of
fritz
lang
's
classic
silent
metropoli
.

howev
,
all
the
set
ar
so
origin
.

the
origin
star
war
movi
ca
n't
even
match
the
grandeur
of
thi
film
's
visual
and
that
is
a
sheer
pleasur
for
the
viewer-it
give
us
hope
of
even
greater
thing
for
the
upcom
episod
.

the
costum
ar
remark
and
have
jean-paul
gaultier
written
all
over
them
.

whether
it
queen
amadala
's
gigant
wardrob
complet
with
gold-embroideri
and
feather
,
or
the
jedi
'
simpl
brown
uniform
,
the
costum
design
ha
fuse
talent
with
outrag
.

the
costum
ar
on
of
the
true
delight
of
watch
the
movi
.

as
for
john
william
'
score
,
i
do
n't
think
he
's
done
on
as
complex
or
power
sinc
i
ca
n't
even
rememb
.

it
is
as
epic
as
hi
schindler
's
list
score
and
as
thrill
and
zest
as
jaw
.

it
includ
the
bare
bone
of
hi
music
from
the
previou
three
film
,
but
william
ha
ad
on
,
made
the
music
much
more
intens
and
move
.

what
with
the
overwhelm
hoopla
that
circl
thi
movi
,
on
might
come
in
with
high
expect
and
be
disappoint
.

there
is
veri
littl
to
hate
in
the
film
:
it
's
a
veri
accomplish
and
skillfulli
made
flick
.

it
is
the
best
``
fun
''
film
and
the
best
big-budget
film
out
todai
,
most
definit
.
