whale
is

it
's
a
safe
bet
that
a
good
chunk
of
them
have
seen
hi
movi
.

if
we
ar
to
believ
the
semi-biograph
god
and
monster
,
whale
would
have
want
it
to
be
that
wai
.

thi
is
an
insight
,
haunt
explor
of
the
last
dai
of
the
frankenstein
and
bride
of
frankenstein
director
,
and
it
is
notabl
for
introduc
on
of
the
first
complic
gai
charact
in
a
hollywood
movi
.

god
and
monster
ha
no
interest
in
be
a
biopic
of
whale
's
life
becaus
it
track
onli
the
final
few
dai
of
hi
life
,
and
it
's
probabl
a
better
movi
for
it
.

it
's
focu
is
on
whale
's
-lrb-
ian
mckellen
-rrb-
untradit
and
decept
lust
for
heterosexu
garden
clayton

it
begin
with
whale

a
fairli
talent
artist
,
asid
from

a
director
-rrb-
ask
boon
to
``
sit
for

,
''
-lrb-
pose
for
a
portrait

.

at
first
,
boon
doe
n't
realiz
that
whale
is
gai
and
grow
fascin
with
the
old
man

when
he
doe
discov

sexual
orient
from
hi
dedic
and
protect
maid
-lrb-
lynn
redgrav
-rrb-
,
he
is
frighten
,
refus
to
sit
for
the

.

but
he
come
back
,
onli
to
storm
out
again
,
disgust
with
whale
's
``
locker
room
talk
.
''

boon
return
yet
anoth
time
,
after
whale
promis
to
tone
down
the
aforement
``
locker
room
talk
,
''
and
find
their
platon
relationship
to
be
strengthen
.

meanwhil
,
jimmi
himself
is
suffer
from
hallucin
and
mental
attack
as
a
result
of
hi
stroke
not
long
ago
.

hi
ailment
lead
to
desper
and
depress
,
which
build
to
the
point
where
he
is
forc
to
ask
boon
for
an
incredul
big
favor
.

what
is
perhap
most
sensat
about
god
and
monster
is
brendan
fraser
's
bravura
perform
;
up
until
see
thi
film
i
intens
dislik
the
young
actor
becaus
of
hi
tendenc
to
ruin
the
movi
he
is
in
-lrb-
blast
from
the
past
,
for
exampl
-rrb-
.

i
wa
surpris
how
express
an
actor
he
prove
himself
to
be
here
.

thi
is
impress
becaus
hi
charact
's
dialogu
is
minim
,
with
mckellan
do
most
of
the
talk
.

that
requir
fraser
to
act
through
bodi
languag
;
a
difficult
skill
to
master
,
but
someth
he
prove
capabl
of
do
well
.

thi
is
not
to
ignor
mckellan
's
oscar
nomin
turn
.

he
earn
that
nomin
with
hi
touch
perform
here
-lrb-
although
,
at
the
risk
of
sound
like
a
philistin
,
i
would
have
chosen
hi
perform
as
the
nazi
in
apt
pupil
for
the

an

whale
dread
be
rememb

for
hi
work
in
the
hollywood
horror
genr
,
and
he
thought
hollywood
to
be
the
equival

a
battlefield
.

he
rejoic
in
be
free
from
it
,
onli
reluctantli
go
to

in
the
end
,
perhap
,
it
is
what

the
