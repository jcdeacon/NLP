so
far

out
of
all
of
these
move
,
howev
,
the
on
that
is
most
similar
to
the
latest
incarn
,
``
10

hate
about
you
,
''
is
thi
past
januari
's
mediocr

although
similar
in

is
an
infinit
superior
film
in
everi

from
the

give
the
best
group
of
perform
in
a
teen
comedi
sinc
1985

breakfast
club

''

and
to
top
it
all
off
,
in
the
inevit
climax
set
at

at

we
did
n't

.

as
you
can
see
,
``
10
thing
i
hate
about
you
''
includ
a
huge
number
of
charact
,
some
of
which
i
have
n't
even
mention
,
such
as
kat
's
shakespear-obsess
friend
,
mandella
-lrb-
susan
mai
pratt
-rrb-
and
bianca
's
materialist
comrad
,
chastiti
-lrb-
gabriel
union
-rrb-
.

at
a
short
,
but
well-us
run
time
ofminut
,
all
of
the
charact
ar
perfectli
handl
,
satisfyingli
develop
,
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
ar
not
treat
as
caricatur
-lrb-
anoth
flaw
of
``
she
's
all
that
,
''
where
the
bad
gui
-lrb-
and
gal
-rrb-
ran
around
constantli
sai
,
``
you
're
vapor
''
-rrb-
.

sinc
i
could
sympath
with
the
realist
depict
of
the
central
charact
,
and
sinc
mani
of
the
comed
and
dramat
scene
were
surprisingli
effect
,
i
got
complet
caught
up
in
all
of
the
relationship
and
wa
thoroughli
entertain
.

asid
from
a
good
screenplai
,
it
's
the
perform
that
can
make
or
break
a
movi
,
and
director
junger
ha
realli
hit
the
jackpot
.

asid
from
joseph
gordon-levitt
-lrb-
``
3rd
rock
from
the
sun
''
-rrb-
,
who
give
hi
strongest
perform
to
date
here
,
none
of
the
actor
ar
that
well-known
,
but
it
is
thi
aspect
that
bring
a
particular
fresh
to
the
proceed
.

as
the
main
charact
of
kat
,
julia
stile
-lrb-
last
seen
in
the
miniseri
``
the
'60s
''
-rrb-
is
marvel
and
alwai
believ
,
and
certainli
ha
a
bright
futur
ahead
of
her
.

even
though
it
is
her
role
that
is
initi
the
most
difficult
and
hard-edg
,
it
wa
easi
to
identifi
with
kat
's
wai
of
think
-lrb-
she
is
against
the
silli
tradit
of
the
prom
and
love
read
sylvia
plath
-rrb-
,
and
i
complet
admir
her
individu
.

no
on
,
i
think
,
could
have
portrai
her
as
perfectli
as
stile
doe
.

heath
ledger
,
as
the
infam
bad-boi
of
the
town
,
inject
much
life
into
patrick
,
and
ha
a
lot
of
chemistri
with
stile
.

on
other
actor
of
note
is
larisa
oleynik
who
,
with
the
help
of
screenwrit
lutz
and
smith
,
is
abl
to
turn
bianca
into
a
person
with
multi-dimens
,
even
though
she
is
accur
self-center
at
the
on-set
.

in
on
truth
scene
,
cameron
angrili
ask
her
if
she
ha
alwai
been
so
selfish
,
and
bianca
grudgingli
realiz
that
ye
,
she
ha
.

on
off-beat
element
of
the
film
,
and
a
sourc
of
some
hearti
laugh
,
is
the
wai
that
the
school
's
staff
act
,
which
is
strikingli
unform
.

allison
jannei
,
as
the
guidanc
counselor
ms.
perki
,
who
is
write
a
trashi
harlequin
romanc
novel
,
is
comic
dynamit
,
as
is
daryl
``
chill
''
mitchel
as
the
english
teacher
,
who
read
shakespear
to
the
class
in
rap
and
,
at
on
point
,
send
kat
to
the
offic
becaus
,
for
onc
,
she
actual
think
on
of
hi
assign
is
realli
good
.

although
there
ar
a
few
cheap
laugh
that
ar
thrown
into
the
film
near
the
begin
,
most
of
it
actual
work
,
especi
in
the
humor
and
witti
dialogu
exchang
and
quirk
between
the
charact
.

in
on
veri
funni
scene
,
chastiti
ask
,
``
i
know
peopl
can
be
overwhelm
,
and
thei
can
be
underwhelm
,
but
can
peopl
just
be
...
whelm
?
''

at
anoth
point
,
bianca
and
kat
's
father
-lrb-
a
stand-out
larri
miller
-rrb-
,
who
is
constantli
terrifi
that
hi
daughter
ar
go
to
get
pregnant
,
onli
allow
bianca
to
go
to
the
prom
on
on
occas
:
befor
she
leav
,
she
ha
to
put
on
the
heavi
fat
suit
he
ha
so
she
will
get
an
idea
of
what
it
's
like
to
be
pregnant
.

``
10
thing
i
hate
about
you
''
onc
and
for
all
prove
that
there
is
still
life
in
the
teen
comedi
genr
,
and
thi
movi
is
probabl
more
reminisc
of
the
great
john
hugh
than
ani
other
film
of
the
'90s
.

it
also
help
that
the
movi
ha
a
perfectli-assembl
soundtrack
,
mix
indi-rock
with
new
wave
'80s
song
-lrb-
and
with
,
thank
good
,
no
rap
-rrb-
.

by
the
film
's
end
,
it
actual
had
me
root
for
certain
charact
to
get
togeth
,
and
i
wa
also
quit
pleas
with
how
everyth
wa
wrap
up
,
especi
in
the
final
scene
involv
kat
and
bianca
,
kat
and
her
father
,
and
a
flawlessli-act
and
move
sequenc
in
which
kat
get
up
to
read
the
poem
she
ha
written
for
her
english
class
-lrb-
thi
is
where
the
titl
come
from
-rrb-
.

luckili
,
i
doubt
i
would
be
abl
to
find
ten
thing
i
hate
about
``
10
thing
i
hate
about
you
,
''
but
the
posit
aspect
of
the
film
far
out-number
ten.-copyright
