he

cynic

and
no
longer
abl
to
feel
the

success
and

and
these

the
onli
person
who
seem
abl
to
appreci
beauti
and
freedom
and
life
is
the
person
most
depriv
of
it
:
a

teen
from
across

street
who
is
practic
imprison
by
a
domin

when
lester
embark
on
a
mad
scrambl
to
feel
the
edg
again
,
the
fact
that
he
ha
quit
hi

feel
what
it
's

and
hi
newfound

ruffl
a
lot
of

will

peopl
sai
it
all

world
.

the
depriv/appreci
cycl
is
a
major
theme
of
american
beauti
.

american
beauti
is
a
non-formula
,
intellig
and
articul
movi
that
offer
fantast
perform
by
everyon
in
the
cast
,
especi
kevin
spacei
,
who
is
simpli
gosh
darn
amaz
thi
movi
.

the
thing
i
like
about
american
beauti
is
that
there
is
no
sentiment
music
,
no
hospit
scene
nor
ani
overli
dramat
hokum
.

the
movi
entertain
and
offer
brilliant
perform
just
as
is
.

if
you
ar
in
the
mood
for
a
thought
,
non-formula
flick
,
i
highli
recommend
american
beauti
.
