thu
,
``
belov
''
becom
a
sorta-redux
of
the
andrei
tarkofski

classic
,
``

where

ha
materi
when
he
is
orbit
over
a

with
a
complex
brain

that
film
spoke
volum
about
human
and
our
memori
,
how
we
ar
constantli
regret
what
happen
in
the
past
,
and
when
if
it
ever
liter
came
back
to
haunt
us
,
it
would
control
us
complet
.

``
belov
''
move
along
freeli
,
without
a
lot
of
explan
,
and
for
the
most
part
,
thi
is
extrem
respect
.

the
most
interest
film
ar
the
on
that
do
n't
explain
everyth
for
us
,
leav
gap
in
the
charact
that
we
ar
suppos
to
fill
in
with
how
thei
act
in
the
present
tens
.

seth
is
never
fulli
explain
as
a
charact
,
but
we
understand
all
her
action
sinc
she
's
be
plai
by
oprah
winfrei
.

it
's
been
well
over
a
decad
sinc
her
last
major
perform
in
``
the
color
purpl
,
''
but
judg
from
these
two
film
,
i
'll
bet
she
's
on
of
the
best
actress
work
todai
...
if
she
wa
strictli
an
actress
.

her
talk
show
,
which
i
suppos
is
a
great
entiti
,
ha
prevent
her
from
becom
a
noteworthi
actress
,
and
that
's
a
shame
becaus
she
bring
so
much
to
thi
movi
.

emot
.

.

strength
.

watch
the
strong
seth
,
who
's
so
afraid
of
the
past
that
she
's
built
a
rather
strong
protect
coat
around
herself
,
break
down
when
she
discov
who
belov
realli
is
is
what
make
thi
movi
realli
great
.

she
make
it
real
.

that
's
not
to
sai
thi
is
a
perfect
film
.

in
fact
,
i
'd
wager
to
sai
that
the
fact
that
it
's
confus
and
pain
to
watch
is
what
prevent
thi
from
be
the
truli
great
film
it
is
.

while
oprah
's
perform
is
power
and
easili
sympathet
-lrb-
and
i
'm
dy
to
see
her
win
at
least
an
oscar
nomin
thi
februari
-rrb-
,
the
structur
of
the
film
,
which
doe
n't
show
what
happen
to
her
children
till
halfwai
through
the
film
,
prevent
us
from
realli
make
a
cohes
connect
to
the
film
.

it
doe
n't
necessarili
move
as
though
thei
're
memori
of
on
particular
charact
,
and
by
the
end
,
it
ha
lost
control
over
seth
,
and
as
she
take
to
bed
,
we
ar
unabl
to
truli
identifi
with
her
anymor
.

but
despit
it
tedious
,
perhap
that
's
the
point
.

the
distanc
by
the
end
of
the
film
mai
be
just
part
of
the
wai
it
ha
been
built
from
the
start
,
sinc
thei
figur
she
ha
cross
over
from
be
identifi
,
and
it
need
to
get
back
with
realiti
.

and
for
the
most
part
,
thi
film
seem
like
the
cry
of
pain
from
the
slave
that
it
realli
want
to
be
.

jonathan
demm
's
direct
is
bizarr
,
in
natur
with
the
stori
,
and
he
creat
the
right
mood
,
make
it
a
tough
film
to
sit
through
,
make
sure
that
the
audienc
feel
as
uncomfort
as
the
charact
.

there
's
more
to
admir
here
,
like
the
wai
that
the
flashback
pop
up
freeli
and
without
real
organ
,
just
like
thei
would
be
in
real
life
;
and
the
wai
that
the
end
leav
it
somewhat
open
to
more
pain
and
suffer
,
but
lace
with
a
touch
of
optim
.

the
act
,
not
onli
from
winfrei
,
is
amaz
,
and
i
anticip
not
onli
she
will
get
an
oscar
nomin
.

everyon
ha
been
rave
about
thandi
newton
's
perform
,
and
how
it
should
be
reward
.

howev
,
it
must
be
note
that
out
of
everyon
,
she
had
the
easiest
part
.

act
like
a
babi
.

throw
thing
.

stumbl
around
.

chew
food
with
your
mouth
open
.

i
do
think
there
's
anoth
perform
worthi
of
oscar
conisder
,
but
it
's
kimberli
elis
,
as
the
daugher
who
ha
to
stai
sensibl
and
sane
,
and
ha
to
carri
the
burden
of
her
mother
's
loss
of
realiti
toward
the
end
.

it
's
not
that
newton
is
n't
great
:
she
's
as
annoi
and
wacki
as
the
role
demand
.

it
's
just
that
elis
ha
the
tougher
job
and
pull
it
off
even
better
.

despit
the
fact
that
thi
film
ha
winfrei
written
all
over
it
,
and
not
that
of
writer
morrison
or
director
demm
,
``
belov
''
ha
still
not
done
well
.

cost
,
i
think
,
around
nineti
million
dollar
,
it
ha
sinc
gross
about
twenti-two
.

unfortun
,
thi
film
is
a
littl
too
intens
for
viewer
,
even
for
me
,
and
i
can
stand
almost
anyth
-lrb-
i
recent
view
the
2Â 1/2
hour
long
epic
``
caligula
,
''
the
worst
film
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
,
and
did
it
in
a
mere
2
sit
-rrb-
.

although
i
respect
``
belov
,
''
i
ca
n't
sai
that
i
realli
enjoi
it
.
