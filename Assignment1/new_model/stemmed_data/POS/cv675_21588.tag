three
thing
i
learn
from
``
be
john
malkovich
''
:
when
get
on
the
elev
for
your
first
dai
of
work
on
the1/2th
floor
of
a
build
,
alwai
bring
your
crowbar
;
do
n't
stand
in
the
wai
of
your
wife
's
actual
as
a
man
;
and
,
whenev
enter
a
portal
into
the
mind
of
anoth
human
be
,
wear
old
cloth
,
becaus
,
hei
,
it
's
muddi
in
there
.

``
be
john
malkovich
''
is
the
most
origin
film
to
come
down
the
pike
in
a
veri
long
time
.

wildli
surrealist
,
yet
present
in
a
down-to-earth
,
funki
style
,
thi
is
the
kind
of
movi
that
stick
in
your
head
.

after
savor
the
sheer
invent
of
the
storylin
,
you
roll
around
the
wealth
of
idea
contain
within
it
.

from
the
ethic
of
relationship
and
polit
of
immort
to
the
veri
natur
of
ident
itself
,
there
's
a
lot
to
think
about
here
.

just
do
n't
forget
to
have
fun
.

clearli
,
all
parti
involv
in
the
make
of
the
film
certainli
did
,
start
with
writer
charl
kaufman
.

``
i
wrote
`
be
john
malkovich
'
without
an
outlin
,
''
he
explain
in
the
press
note
,
``
blindli
,
with
no
sens
of
direct
or
purpos
.
''

it
's
import
to
me
that
i
do
n't
have
a
map
befor
i
start
.

thi
allow
me
to
surpris
myself
,
stai

and
,
hopefulli
,
allow
the
unconsci
to
surfac
.

-lrb-

-rrb-
,
who
delight
in

and
then
there
's
the
hole
behind
the
file
cabinet
,
which
turn
out
to
be
a
portal
into
the
mind
of
actor
john

.

craig
learn
that
anyon
who
enter
the
portal
get
whoosh
into
the
subconsci
of
malkovich
,
where
thei
can

with

you

by
the
wai
,
if
you
're
concern
that
i
gave
awai
too
much
of
the
plot
,
rest
assur
--
i
bare
scratch
the
surfac
.

on
of
the
most
satisfi
aspect
of
the
fabl
is
that
kaufman
is
not
content
to
simpli
milk
laugh
from
hi
bizarr
set-up
.

instead
,
he
crawl
into
the
dark
premis
as
complet
as
craig
crawl
into

,
rummag
around
and

consequ

the
malko-visit
to

,
maxin
and
,
of

,
john

himself
.

the
perform
ar
superb
.

malkovich
-lrb-
best
known
to
mainstream
audienc
for
hi
work
in
``

''
``

and

the
guilti-pleasur
``

-rrb-
tweak
hi
own
imag
in
a
dandi
self-deprec
turn
.

far
from
hi
effet
,
vagu
reptilian
persona
,
thi
malkovich
is
just
anoth
schlub
,
drink
with

the
big
surpris
come
from
catherin
keener
and
cameron
diaz
,
both
plai
against
type
.

,
usual
cast

is

curli

,
shed
her
perpetu
sunni
smile
and
draw
big
laugh
as
a
woman
thrown
into
extrem
sexual
confus
after
take
a
ride
in
malkovich
.

``
be
john
malkovich
''
stumbl
toward
the
end
,
as
jonz
and
kaufman
try
too
hard
to
resolv
the
variou
subplot
.

addit
charact
and
increasingli
complex
explan
lead
to
a
clutter
final
.

regardless
,
thi
contemporari
``

''
is
a
real
treat
.

i
enjoi
watch
``

but
onli
later
,
after
reflect
on
the
film
,
did
it
reson
fulli
hit
me
.

at
on

craig

,
``
do
