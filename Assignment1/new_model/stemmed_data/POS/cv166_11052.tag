as
if
that
were

,
elli

discoveri
lead
her
to
the
nation
's
capit
where
she
again
run
into
palmer
.

contact
is
base
on
the
novel
by
carl
sagan
and
deal
heavili
with
the
subject
of
scienc
vs.
religion
.

the
impress
thing
is
how
well
both
aspect
ar
present
,
with
no
sign
of
bia
.

argument
for
both
side
ar
intellig
,
solid
,
and
thought-provok
.

when
palmer
join
a
select
committe
to

an

-lrb-
of
which
elli
is
a
lead
candid
-rrb-
,
person
convict
plai
a
more
import
role
than
love
interest
.

the
question
is
,
can
a
person
who
doe
n't
believ
in
god
truli
be
the
best
repres
of
earth
when
90
%
of
the
planet
*
doe
*
believ
in
a
higher
power
?

even
when
the
film
wrap
up
,
it
's
uncertain
whether
it
's
meant
to
plai
as
an
advoc
for
religion
,
scienc
,
both
,
or
even
neither
,
and
in
our
modern
dai
societi
where
``
right
and
wrong
''
is
onli
opinion
-lrb-
at
least
speak
``
polit
correctli
''
-rrb-
,
the
ambigu
is
an
incent
.

do
n't
get
me
wrong
.

as
much
as
it
sound
like
it
,
contact
is
n't
mere
a
theologi
class
roll
into
a
reel
of
film
.

it
's
a
*
highli
*
enjoy
two
and
a
half
hour
.

despit
it
seemingli
heavi
issu
,
it
's
not
a
tediou
undertak
to
watch
thi
film
.

the
special
effect
ar
outstand
,
though
-lrb-
warn
!
-rrb-

highli
depreci
on
the
small
screen
.

even
so
,
some
of
the
subtl
visual
effect
-lrb-
that
will
like
go
unnot
by
mani
-rrb-
ar
even
more
impress
than
on
more
recogniz
as
``
sci-fi
''
.

the
storytel
is
rich
and
complet
,
and
although
there
ar
moment
in
the
film
that
feel
quit
pretenti
-lrb-
and
at
time
,
even
hokei
-rrb-
,
it
's
easili
on
of
the
best
1997
film
,
and
on
of
the
best
sci-fi
film
i
've
ever
seen
.

thi
is
zemecki

back
to
the

and
for
those
of
