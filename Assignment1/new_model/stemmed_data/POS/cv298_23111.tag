as
in
the
origin
film
,
``
toi
stori
2
''
contain
first-rate
anim
,
and
pixar
studio
ha
done
a
remark
job
improv
on
the
impress
work
thei
did
there
.

reportedli
,
the
film
wa
origin
slate
for
a
direct-to-video
releas
,
but
after
see
the
improv
that
had
been
made
,
disnei
rightli
decid
to
releas
it
into
theater
.

the
film
is
well
worth
see
on
the
big
screen
.

the
color
ar
bright
,
the
textur
sharp
,
and
even
the
human
charact
look
more
``
human
.
''

the
anim
is
consist
seamless
,
with
the
action
fast
and
furiou
and
the
facial
express
believ
.

there
ar
so
mani
impress
sequenc
that
i
'd
find
it
imposs
to
list
them
here
,
but
i
wa
particularli
wow
by
a
scene
where
buzz
and
hi
cohort
must
get
across
a
busi
intersect
to
get
to
al
'
s
toi
barn
,
the
store
own
by
woodi
's
captor
.

pixar
's
rendit
of
the
famili
dog
is
also
nice
done
,
with
fur
so
realist
you
almost
feel
you
could
reach
out
and
touch
it
.

the
voic
work
is
also
perfectli
complementari
,
and
as
with
the
first
movi
,
doe
much
to
help
further
charact
develop
.

tom
hank
and
tim
allen
again
disappear
into
their
role
as
woodi
and
buzz
,
make
you
forget
who
is
do
the
voic
.

it
wa
woodi
and
buzz
up
there
,
not
tom
and
tim
.

all
the
cast
member
from
the
origin
repris
their
role
,
and
each
is
excel
.

sever
new
voic
have
been
ad
,
with
joan
cusack
,
kelsei
grammer
,
and
wayn
knight
do
fine
work
.

``
toi
stori
2
''
is
strong
in
character
,
and
is
abl
to
expand
on
what
we
saw
in
the
first
movi
.

woodi
face
difficult
choic
,
while
buzz
is
confront
with
a
new
buzz
who
ha
n't
yet
realiz
hi
statu
as
a
toi
,
forc
him
to
see
what
he
us
to
be
like
.

the
new
charact
ar
also
develop
quit
well
,
especi
jess
,
who
narrat
a
sarah
mclachlan-aid
flashback
illustr
how
she
wa
love
,
then
forgotten
by
her
owner
.

it
mai
be
comput-anim
,
and
it
mai
have
sappi
music
,
but
it
's
downright
touch
.

the
script
,
despit
have
a
stori
and
screenplai
each
credit
to
four
differ
writer
,
is
endlessli
clever
and
invent
,
especi
consid
that
it
's
a
sequel
.

the
reason
``
toi
stori
2
''
work
where
other
movi
sequel
fail
is
that
it
refus
to
just
capit
on
the
origin
's
success
by
re-do
the
same
stori
and
us
the
same
charact
.

not
thi
on
.

chang
,
new
