some
time
ago
,
a
young
director
wa
given
the
opportun
to
direct
the
screen
version
of
a
popular
novel
.

the
novel
wa
a
summer
smash
,
top
best-seller
list
across
the
countri
and
alreadi
draw
specul
as
to
which
popular
actor
of
the
dai
might
plai
the
lead
.

the
onli
problem
:
the
novel
wa
n't
veri
good
.

it
wa
far
more
pulp
than
pulitz
.

but
the
director
realiz
that
,
no
matter
how
pedestrian
the
prose
,
thi
book
realli
grab
peopl-that
the
author
,
while
not
a
great
writer
,
wa
a
fantast
storytel
.

so
he
took
on
the
project
,
convinc
he
could
make
someth
happen
on
screen
.

the
director
?

franci
ford
coppola
.

the
book
,
of
cours
,
wa
mario
puzo
's
the
godfath
.

the
rest
,
as
thei
sai
in
showbiz
,
wa
histori
.

by
bring
up
the
godfath
,
i
do
n't
mean
to
suggest
that
robert
altman
's
the
gingerbread
man
is
destin
for
that
level
of
great
.

but
the
parallel
doe
suggest
that
it
is
possibl
to
creat
great
cinema
from
question
sourc
materi
.

can
you
get
ani
more
question
than
john
grisham
?

depend
on
whom
you
ask
.

but
there
's
no
question
that
grisham
's
work
grab
peopl
.

like
puzo
,
grisham
is
a
better
storytel
than
a
writer-unlik
fellow
hack
michael
crichton
,
who
is
a
good
idea
man
but
who
ca
n't
tell
a
well-construct
stori
from
a
can
of
spam
.

so
someth
in
grisham
's
unpublish
stori
of
a
cocki
savannah
lawyer
who
get
involv
in
a
deadli
famili
squabbl
drew
the
attent
of
robert
altman
,
who
atyear
old
remain
on
of
america
's
greatest
live
filmmak
.

the
result
is
a
grip
thriller
that
,
while
fall
short
of
classic
cinema
,
deserv
it
place
in
the
altman
canon
.

>
from
it
open
shot
to
the
close
credit
,
the
gingerbread
man
is
permeat
with
a
sens
of
dread
,
with
a
fear
of
the
natur
destruct
forc
of
the
univers
.

thi
terrif
sens
of
mood
is
a
classic
altman
touch
.

wit
said
open
shot
:
we
see
an
aerial
view
of
coastal
georgia
with
it
writh
,
undul
landscap
while
the
soundtrack
grumbl
omin
in
our
ear
.

we
roll
over
the
hill
into
the
town
of
savannah
,
then
zoom
in
close
on
a
red
sport
car
speed
over
a
bridg
while
it
driver
chatter
oblivi
on
hi
cell
phone
.

right
awai
we
know
that
the
driver
of
that
car
is
in
for
a
few
surpris
.

pai
attent
,
boi
and
girl-thi
shot
wa
not
conceiv
by
john
grisham
,
but
by
altman
.

thi
is
what
a
great
director
can
do
for
question
sourc
materi
.

the
sport
car
belong
to
rick
magrud
-lrb-
kenneth
branagh
-rrb-
,
the
aforement
hotshot
attornei
who
special
in
polic
brutal
case
.

magrud
ha
just
won
a
high
profil
case
and
celebr
that
night
with
a
cater
parti
at
hi
offic
.

outsid
after
the
parti
he
meet
on
of
the
waitress
,
mallori
doss
-lrb-
embeth
davidzt
-rrb-
,
just
as
she
realiz
her
car
ha
been
stolen
.

driven
by
southern
chivalri
,
a
drive
rainstorm
and
hi
unspoken
attract
to
the
fragil
waitress
,
magrud
offer
her
a
ride
home
.

there
he
learn
more
about
mallori
's
life
than
he
bargain
for
.

her
car
wa
stolen
by
her
schizophren
father
dixon
-lrb-
robert
duval
-rrb-
,
a
ted
kyzynski-style
whacko
who
ha
been
stalk
and
terror
hi
own
daughter
.

magrud
,
perhap
influenc
by
mallori
's
decis
to
strip
off
her
wet
cloth
in
front
of
him
,
is
sympathet
to
her
plight
,
and
offer
to
help
her
get
her
father
commit-right
after
he
sleep
with
her
,
of
cours
.

thi
simpl
offer
of
help
lead
magrud
down
a
danger
path
with
a
black
end
.

he
succe
in
have
dixon
incarcer
in
a
mental
hospit
,
and
for
a
moment
all
appear
well
.

but
then
dixon
's
crack
team
of
homeless
commando
bust
him
out
of
the
lockup-and
suddenli
magrud
find
himself
,
mallori
and
hi
own
children
in
danger
.

the
cop
wo
n't
lift
a
finger
to
help
a
liber
attornei
.

daryl
hannah
-rrb-
and
hi
bumbl
privat-ey
sidekick
clyde
-lrb-
robert
downei
jr
-rrb-
.

if
thi
predica
wa
n't
bad
enough
,
hurrican
geraldo
is
bear
down
on
savannah
and
throw
the
world
into
chao
.

altman
mai
provid
the
atmospher
,
but
branagh
's
perform
hold
the
gingerbread
man
togeth
.

an
accomplish
actor
when
he
is
n't
direct
himself
in
vaniti
product
,
branagh
doe
a
fine
job
of
make
rick
a
sympathet
hero
while
cast
doubt
upon
hi
motiv
.

is
hi
offer
of
help
to
mallori
an
act
of
kind
,
or
of
egot
?

magrud
is
so
sure
of
hi
place
in
the
world
that
he
never
consid
that
he
ha
bitten
off
more
than
he
can
chew
until
he
ha
to
swallow
it-and
by
then
it
's
too
late
.

as
the
plot
unfold
,
magrud
learn
that
none
of
us
ar
as
secur
as
we
think
we
ar
.

and
life
is
never
so
bad
that
it
ca
n't
get
wors
.

if
you
're
familiar
with
altman
's
work
,
you
'll
recogn
sever
of
hi
signatur
techniqu
.

charact
ar
not
introduc
in
establish
shot
,
but
rather
ar
allow
to
wander
in
the
background
of
scene
until
their
import
becom
appar
.

crucial
scene
ar
shot
from
the
outsid
through
window
,
make
the
audienc
unwit
voyeur
of
the
action
.

dialog
overlap
and
the
actor
seem
to
slip
natur
into
an
improvis
style
.

and
of
cours
there
's
my
favorit
altman
techniqu-the
obligatori
nude
actress
shot
.

thank
to
altman
,
here
ar
some
of
the
actress
i
've
had
the
pleasur
of
see
nake
:
salli
kellerman
,
juliann
moor
,
madelin
stow
,
even
franc
mcdormand
.

and
now
i
can
add
embeth
davidtz
,
who
look
quit
healthi
in
the
altogeth
.

the
nake
actress
shot
ha
becom
as
ubiquit
to
the
altman
film
as
the
director
cameo
wa
to
the
hitchcock
film
.

is
it
old-school
sexism
,
or
a
clever
in-joke
?

you
be
the
judg
.

but
back
to
the
pictur
at
hand
.

in
the
hand
of
a
mere
mortal
,
the
gingerbread
man
would
have
been
a
routin
thriller
,
no
better
or
wors
than
the
countless
other
we
've
all
endur
.

in
the
hand
of
a
master
like
altman
,
it
becom
an
exercis
in
existenti
doom
,
in
it
own
wai
far
more
success
than
scorses
's
cape
fear
remak
,
which
tri
for
the
same
result
.

what
mai
prevent
it
from
endur
with
altman
's
greatest
work
is
a
weak
third
act-in
fact
,
there
realli
is
no
third
act
in
grisham
's
stori
,
so
it
appear
that
altman
had
to
throw
in
the
hurrican
just
to
jazz
thing
up
.

but
there
ar
true
moment
of
rivet
suspens
,
and
great
perform
by
branagh
,
davidzt
and
downei
jr-more
than
enough
to
see
you
through
.

that
polygram
so
hate
thi
pictur
that
thei
tri
to
steal
final
cut
from
altman
,
and
then
buri
the
market
campaign
when
he
won
it
back
,
should
tell
you
how
utterli
clueless
of
qualiti
most
studio
ar
.

thei
probabl
want
it
to
look
more
like
a
time
to
kill
.

and
that
,
my
friend
,
should
make
you
veri
afraid
.
