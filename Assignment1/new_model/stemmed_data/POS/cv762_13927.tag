-rrb-
.

the
film
itself
is
a
visual
wonder
.

spielberg
favorit
janusz
kaminski
set
the
film
in
a
dark
,
somber
mood
when
appropri
,
and
a
visual
set
when
appropri
as
well
.

at
time
,
the
film
is
veri
slow
,
and
veri
method
.

howev
,
spielberg
is
not
at
hi
finest
here
,
becaus
the
courtroom
scene
have
a
tendenc
to
lag
.

the
film
is
,
in
essenc
,
a
courtroom
drama
,
on
whose
event
ar
oversimplifi
.

the
character
is
also
weak
,
displai
weak
in
build
up
charact
such
as
the
lawyer
baldwin
-lrb-
mcconaughei
-rrb-
,
and
especi
morgan
freeman
's
abolitionist
.

but
spielberg
's
finest
work
in
the
film
,
the
open
scene
,
a
scene
of
cinqu
's
famili
,
and
the
brutal
voyag
of
the
slave
to
america
,
is
altogeth
stun
.

it
is
thi
emot
forc
that
carri
the
film
.

mcconaughei
is
superb
as
the
lawyer
defend
the
african
,
hopkin
is
sensat
as
the
old
adam
,
freeman
is
outstand
when
us
-lrb-
spielberg
vastli
under
us
hi
suprem
talent
-rrb-
,
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
is
stellar
.

the
movi
,
howev
,
belong
to
hounsou
.

hi
emot
intens
is
brilliant
.

spielberg
manag
to
make
even
the
slowest
scene
sparkl
with
focu
on
hounsou
,
and
the
film
's
extraordinari
power
is
simpli
captiv
.

the
film
is
flaw
,
for
most
of
the
support
charact
ar
mere
cardboard
.

but
that
doe
n't
matter
.

the
stori
is
a
grip
on
,
and
on
of
extrem
import
.

kudo
to
spielberg
for
find
it
,
find
the
right
men
for
the
job
,
and
let
the
audienc
listen
to
the
word
of
cinqu
.

a
good
job
all
around
.
