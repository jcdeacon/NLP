anastasia
get
lost
,
and
grow
up
with
no

the

live

hope
to

find
her

the
onli
member
of

who
ar
try
to
put
togeth
a
scheme
to
creat
an
anastasia
to
fool
the
grandmoth
and
get
the
reward
monei

thei
pick
anya
to
pose
as
their
princ
,
and
of
cours
,
it
is
soon
reveal
that
anya
is
in
fact
the
lost
anastasia
.

dimitri
realiz
that
he
can
never
win
her
love
as
he
is
a
common
,
and
meanwhil
,
rasputin
is
not
dead
,
and
plot
hi
reveng
against
the
last
romanov
.

the
plot
is
actual
quit
well
structur
.

there
ar
a
lot
of
complex
that
mai
have
to
be
explain
to
the
kid
later
,
but
it
move
along
fast
enough
that
thei
'll
never
have
time
to
be
bore
.

what
thi
realli
mean
is
that
the
adult
wo
n't
be
bore
by
it
either
.

there
is
a
great
deal
of
banter
between
anya
and
dimitri
that
is
veri
funni
,
and
their
relationship
develop
quit
natur
as
the
film
progress
.

there
is
,
of
cours
,
lot
of
comedi
for
the
kid
,
includ
rasputin
's
pet
bat
,
bartok
-lrb-
hank
azaria
-rrb-
,
who
is
easili
the
funniest
thing
in
the
film
.

howev
,
the
comic
scene
never
distract
from
the
drama
,
but
ar
work
into
the
plot
almost
seamlessli
.

the
anim
is
gorgeou-the
charact
seem
to
come
to
life
through
the
talent
anim
.

not
sinc
beauti
&
the
beast
have
anim
charact
had
so
much
life
to
them
.

even
without
the
voic
,
thei
act
.

the
music
number
in
pari
is
a
show-stopper
,
with
some
of
the
background
render
in
an
impressionist
paint
style
.

as
with
all
recent
anim
featur
,
there
ar
song
,
howev
,
these
song
do
more
than
just
provid
fodder
for
top-40
singer
to
get
on
the
radio
-lrb-
although
there
ar
three
of
them
dure
the
end
credit
-rrb-
.

the
song
ar
all
veri
catchi
,
and
advanc
the
plot
,
instead
of
just
be
showpiec
-lrb-
except
for
the
pari
number
,
but
that
's
so
much
fun
,
it
's
okai
...
-rrb-
.

i
ca
n't
reccomend
anastasia
highli
enough
.

it
's
a
wonder
film
that
rank
right
up
there
with
other
anim
classic
.

kid
and
adult
alik
will
enjoi
it
,
and
it
's
also
nice
to
have
a
qualiti
