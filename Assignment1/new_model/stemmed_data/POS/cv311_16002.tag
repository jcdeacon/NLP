,
i
want

.

it
creat
a

so
complet
realist

to
everyon
,
simplist
and
realist
-lrb-
no
aggravatingli
condescend
pose
for
the
camera
deal
here
-rrb-
.

the
eldest
son
,
christian
-lrb-
ulrich
thomsen
,
look
a
bit
like
a
young
malcolm
mcdowel
-rrb-
,
is

then
kick
hi
famili
out
of
the
car
,
forc
them
to
walk
to
the
estat
,
just
so
christian
can
be
comfort
.

we
then
meet
helen
-lrb-
paprika
steen
-rrb-
,
their
sister
,
a
woman
who
alwai
seem
to
be
stress-out
,
who
invit
the
driver
of
her
car
-lrb-
gbatokai
dakinah
-rrb-
,
an
american
,
to
to
come
join
her
at
the
parti
she
's
go
to
.

onc
thei
're
all
there
and
settl
in
,
the
parti
begin
,
and
as
custom
,
the
eldest
son
ha
to
make
a
speech
to
hi
dad
,
so
christian
stand
up
,
at
the
head
of
the
tabl
,
and
reveal
the
film
's
punchlin
:
hi
father
rape
all
hi
children
at
a
young
ag
.

but
sinc
thi
is
a
famili/friend
affair
,
hi
confess
becom
more
detest
than
the
suppos
truth
,
and
is
simpli
brush
off
despit
hi
effort
,
and
what
transpir
is
sorta
like
jerri
springer
cross
with
jean
renoir
,
and
it
's
all
terribl
interest
to
watch
.

twist
occur
,
and
soon
the
film
ha
taken
on
a
nearli-farsic
natur
,
but
still
seem
realist
becaus
the
peopl
involv
realli
feel
like
thei
could
reach
such
end
.

the
most
notori
thing
about
thi
film
,
which
ha
been
get
the
most
notic
,
though
,
is
that
the
director
,
thoma
vinterberg
ha
shot
it
in
a
complet
awkward
fashion
.

as
a
member
of
the
danish
filmmak
clan
,
dogm
95
,
a
group
that
ha
vow
to
oppos
``
the
auteur
concept
,
make-up
,
illus
,
and
dramaturg
predict
''
so
that
thei
mai
``
purg
film
so
that
onc
again
the
inner
live
of
the
charact
justifi
the
plot
.
''

i
have
not
seen
``
break
the
wave
,
''
the
other
notabl
film
by
a
member
of
thi
group
-lrb-
lar
von
trier
,
to
be
exact
-rrb-
,
but
``
the
celebr
''
work
exquisit
in
thi
depart
.

it
feel
like
realiti
,
like
you
're
actual
watch
real
peopl
and
not
actor
,
and
as
a
major
pointer
,
ha
been
shot
on
video
.

as
a
result
,
it
look
more
like
the
home
movi
you
never
dare
shot
of
your
famili
than
an
actual
film
,
but
alwai
want
to
.

we
see
kei
moment
in
peopl
's
live
that
thei
would
n't
dare
show
to
the
world
,
and
it
captur
the
farscial
comedi
of
life
so
accur
and
acut
that
thi
style
,
as
iron-showmanship
as
it
realli
is
,
work
perfectli
for
the
natur
of
the
film
.

the
kei
,
though
,
to
thi
film
,
and
the
reason
it
's
not
just
a
cool
danish
import
,
is
becaus
thi
film
is
not
about
reveal
the
truth
as
much
as
it
is
about
the
wai
peopl
react
to
such
an
explos
truth
.

throughout
the
film
,
we
see
a
complet
realiz
debat
over
the
truth
and
the
effect
it
ha
on
the
live
of
those
who
have
learn
to
live
with
li
,
a
debat
so
three-dimension
that
it
could
easili
blow
oliv
stone
and
hi
the-truth-at-all-cost
reason
out
of
the
water
.

of
cours
it
wa
not
right
for
the
father
to
rape
hi
children
,
and
of
cours
,
thei
could
n't
have
fought
back
then
,
and
of
cours
thi
ha
creat
scar
suppress
insid
them
.

and
ye
,
it
's
thearapeut
for
on
to
releas
the
truth
year
later
,
when
thei
know
it
could
easili
destroi
the
on
who
emotion
destroi
them
earlier
.

but
then
again
,
the
father
,
after
all
,
is
not
a
total
bad
gui
,
and
we
can
see
the
emot
complic
that
aris
thank
to
a
perform
by
mortizen
which
is
just
so
great
and
touch
that
while
we
do
believ
that
he
could
have
rape
hi
children
year
earlier
,
we
also
see
a
man
who
ha
also
learn
to
live
with
what
he
's
done
,
and
deep
down
,
feel
true
guilt
that
is
onli
now
begin
to
surfac
.

the
final
scene
,
involv
mortizen
and
everyon
els
,
is
utterli
devast
,
thank
to
him
and
thomsen
,
whose
perform
is
utterli
flawless
and
equal
emotion
complex
.

everyon
els
is
flawless
as
well-the
actor
never
seem
to
be
step
into
the
shoe
of
their
charact
as
much
as
thei
do
walk
comfort
in
them
.

the
actor
or
writer
have
not
made
the
mistak
to
judg
these
charact
in
the
slightest
:
there
ar
no
white
or
black
but
instead
all
grai
,
exactli
like
life
.

as
such
,
``
the
celebr
''
mai
be
the
on
truli
bizarro
film
of
the
year
:
a
work
of
art
so
eerili
close
to
realiti
that
it
's
utterli
disturb
and
utterli
fascin
.
