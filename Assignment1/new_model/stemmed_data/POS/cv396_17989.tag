well
i
'll
be
damn
,
what
a
most
excel
surpris
.

not
to
be
confus
with
the
campi
and
far
inferior
1988
remak
star
ex-porn
star
traci
lord
,
thi
more
recent
attempt
at
remak

1950
's
drive-in
schlockfest
not
of
thi
earth
is
a
real
gem
and
wa
quit
possibl
the
best
sci-fi
flick
of
1995
.

onc
again
,
b-movi
king
roger
corman
is
behind
thi
effort
-lrb-
he
direct
the
origin
-rrb-
but
thi
time
he
appear
onli
in
the
role
of
execut
produc
.

the
rest
of
the
crew
and
cast
ar
rel
unknown
.

it
seem
crimin
that
the
film
wa
releas
direct
to
video
in
most
countri
,
becaus
it
's
an
absolut
must-see
for
sci-fi
fan
and
a
treat
for
anyon
who
enjoi
decent
act
and
written
thriller
with
a
kooki
bent
.

the
plot
in
brief
.

paul
johnson
-lrb-
michael
york
-rrb-
is
an
alien
pose
as
an
eccentr
millionair
who
,
though
need
to
kill
peopl
to
live
,
is
visit
earth
for
far
from
selfish
reason
.

hi
race
is
dy
of
a
mysteri
blood
diseas
and
he
desper
is
try
to
find
a
cure
,
the
kei
of
which
li
in
the
blood
of
human
.

he
visit
and
soon
put
under
hi
spell
the
respect
blood
physician
dr.
rochel
,
whom
he
hypnotis
into
do
secret
research
on
hi
behalf
.

he
also
ha
the
doctor
convinc
smart
and
sexi
nurs
amanda
-lrb-
elizabeth
barond
-rrb-
to
move
in
with
johnson
as
hi
privat
nurs
so
as
to
give
him
the
blood
transfus
which
he
constantli
requir
.

but
befor
long
,
amanda
and
johnson
's
sleazi
chauffeur
releas
that
johnson
is
a
lot
more
than
just
eccentr
.

i
must
admit
,
my
first
glimps
of
the
video
cover
for
not
of
thi
earth
wa
not
encourag
.

british
actor
michael
york
ha
appear
in
some
real
stinker
in
past
few
decad
,
a
far
cry
from
the
qualiti
fare
of
hi
younger
dai
such
as
caberat
-lrb-
1972
-rrb-
.

but
hi
perform
here
as
an
alien
in
human
disguis
is
noth
short
of
outstand
.

the
weird
twitch
and
bizarr
mode
of
speech
,
the
dapper
cloth
and
cool
spectacl
,
the
unexpect
patho
which
he
invest
in
hi
charact
.

york
is
by
turn
hilari
,
menac
and
tragic
.

thi
is
a
tour-de-forc
and
quit
simpli
the
best
perform
i
've
seen
from
him
.

and
while
obvious
made
on
a
modest
budget
,
the
film
boast
enorm
strength
.

the
cast
is
spot
on
,
the
act
is
terrif
and
the
script
is
intellig
,
witti
and
consist
engag
,
cleverli
updat
the
origin
.

the
balanc
of
horror
and
humour
is
just
about
perfect
,
a
mark
contrast
to
the
earlier
remak
from
1988
.

the
film
doe
n't
drag
for
a
second
of
it
90
minut
run
time
thank
to
tight
edit
and
the
sure
hand
of
littl-known
director
terranc
h.
winkless
.

and
it
doe
n't
matter
on
bit
that
the
special
effect
ar
cheesi-thi
is
schlock
after
all
,
even
if
it
is
high
class
schlock
.

in
fact
my
onli
critic
of
the
film
is
that
thing
get
a
tad
weak
toward
the
end
.

tighter
direct
could
have
given
the
climax
more
urgenc
and
a
few
of
the
charact
act
rather
illog
given
their
life-threaten
situat
.

but
these
ar
minor
complaint
.

just
see
it
.

not
of
thi
earth
is
on
of
the
biggest
sci-fi
surpris
in
year
.

and
michael
york
:
in
on
cool
swoop
you
've
made
yourself
a
b-movi
legend
,
dude
.
