earth
is
a
harsh
,
unconsol
drama
about
the
time
when
india
gain
independ
from
britain
and
the
ensu
turmoil
that
engulf
the
subcontin
.

peopl
who
supposedli
love
the
same
land
and
the
same
god
found
themselv
in
bitter
conflict
,
as
the
countri
divid
into
faction
fight
in
the
street
:
indian
and
pakistani
;
muslim
,
hindu
,
sikh
,
parse
.

the
stori
take
place
in
lahor
,
which
wa
indian
befor
partit
,
and
pakistani
afterward
,
regardless
of
what
it
citizen
might
call
themselv
.

the
action
is
seen
through
the
ey
of
lenni
-lrb-
maaia
sethna
-rrb-
,
a
young
parse
girl
,
but
it
is
realli
about
her
nanni
,
shanta
.

shanta
ha
a
small
circl
of
male
admir
.

two
of
the
men
ar
suitor
:
hasan
-lrb-
rahul
khanna
-rrb-
,
a
hindu
,
and
dil
navaz
-lrb-
aamir
khan
-rrb-
,
a
muslim
.

the
other
--
sikh
,
hindu
,
muslim
--
ar
older
;
some
ar
marri
;
but
all
appreci
shanta
,
who
is
plai
by
the
stirringli
beauti
nandita
da
.

-lrb-
she
also
star
in
deepa
mehta
's
previou
film
,
fire
,
the
first
part
of
a
themat
trilogi
which
will
conclud
with
water
.
-rrb-

in
an
earli
scene
,
the
men
ar
sit
in
a
park
talk
with
shanta
and
lenni
;
polit
tension
in
the
countri
is
grow
as
the
dai
of
independ
near
.

on
of
the
men
remark
,
jokingli
,
that
their
littl
group
is
probabl
on
of
the
last
place
in
the
citi
where
the
differ
religion
can
still
get
along
.

he
is
wrong
:
the
men
make
barb
littl
comment
to
each
other
,
spoken
like
joke
,
but
with
an
undercurr
of
fanatic
.

the
tenor
of
these
exchang
grow
darker
and
more
bitter
as
the
movi
progress
.

it
is
easi
to
perceiv
,
in
these
squabbl
,
the
trajectori
which
end
in
mass
violenc
and
slaughter
.

the
group
around
shanta
repres
,
in
a
sens
,
a
unit
india
,
and
shanta
herself
the
ideal
motherland
--
on
which
all
love
,
which
inspir
hindu
,
muslim
,
and
sikh
to
live
peacabl
togeth
.

but
the
circl
around
shanta
is
sunder
,
as
is
the
state
.

a
sikh
is
persecut
,
hide
,
then
flee
.

anoth
man
is
murder
.

the
group
of
friend
will
not
meet
again
.

the
movi
is
rife
with
imag
of
breakag
and
destruct
:
a
plate
shatter
on
the
floor
,
a
stuf
toi
torn
apart
by
an
upset
child
,
and
,
most
brutal
,
when
the
tension
escal
into
violenc
,
a
man
is
held
down
,
ti
between
two
car
,
and
rip
in
half
by
the
oppos
movement
of
the
vehicl
.

it
is
a
viscer
and
effect
metaphor
for
a
countri
which
is
be
destroi
just
as
painfulli
.

the
crux
of
earth
's
plot
is
the
transform
undergon
by
dil
navaz
.

hi
sister
ar
kill
in
brutal
fashion
,
by
hindu
,
becaus
thei
ar
muslim
.

dil
navaz
seek
solac
from
shanta
,
and
ask
in
desper
that
she
marri
him
.

but
she
love
hasan
,
and
tenderli
refus
dil
navaz
's
offer
.

the
combin
of
famili
anguish
and
romant
reject
twist
insid
him
,
and
it
is
easi
to
see
how
he
is
seduc
by
the
grow
mob
mental
:
the
muslim
caus
give
him
a
motiv
to
vent
hi
anger
and
hate
.

despit
the
thing
he
later
doe
,
it
is
to
the
credit
of
earth
that
it
doe
not
simpli
denounc
dil
navaz
and
those
like
him
,
but
show
how
circumst
can
make
decent
enough
men
do
monstrou
thing
.

the
conclus
--
the
consequ
of
dil
navaz
's
transform
--
is
rather
abrupt
.

the
stori
earth
tell
doe
not
end
.

it
just
stop
.

it
is
an
appropri
finish
:
give
us
closur
would
have
impart
,
at
least
on
an
aesthet
level
,
a
sens
of
resolut
,
of
satisfact
.

but
there
wa
no
resolut
for
india
and
pakistan
--
thei
have
been
at
war
,
on
a
small
or
larg
scale
,
for
decad
.

sinc
the
person
drama
in
earth
mirror
the
polit
struggl
of
a
nation
,
it
is
onli
right
that
those
drama
should
have
no
terminu
.

there
is
no
heal
to
be
had
,
no
closur
,
on
ani
level
-lrb-
despit
the
needless
,
tack-on
end
,
with
voic-over
narrat
from
lenni
as
an
adult
,
frame
the
stori
-rrb-
.

earth
is
,
in
some
wai
,
an
unexcept
movi
.

it
doe
not
reinvent
the
wheel
,
follow
instead
the
standard
pattern
of
histor
drama
.

but
deepa
mehta
's
directon
is
assur
,
and
the
issu
she
address
run
deep
.

earth
doe
for
india
what
movi
like
zhang
yimou
's
to
live
and
tian
zhuangzhuang
's
the
blue
kite
did
for
china
:
thei
show
us
the
agoni
endur
by
unremark
peopl
who
had
the
bad
luck
to
be
caught
up
and
smash
in
the
crucibl
of
histori
.

such
film
strike
me
as
inher
valuabl
,
even
when
flaw
.

thei
mai
be
bias
or
inaccur
,
but
thei
bear
the
weight
of
human
hardship
,
and
thi
confer
on
them
a
nobil
and
graviti
which
other
,
more
invent
film
,
often
lack
.

it
is
notabl
that
all
three
movi
were
ban
in
their
nativ
countri
:
the
event
shown
mai
have
happen
decad
ago
,
but
thei
still
touch
a
nerv
.

the
issu
tackl
in
earth
have
a
particular
urgenc
in
light
of
the
nuclear
test
bomb
that
took
place
last
year
.

in
the
near
futur
,
india
and
pakistan
mai
launch
nuclear
missil
at
each
other
.

at
the
time
of
the
test
i
had
some
understand
of
the
reason
why
thi
might
happen
;
after
see
earth
,
i
have
a
much
,
much
better
understand
.
