as
to
what
the
three-digit
number

the
remaind
of
the

consist
of
elliot

variou
fantasi
that
incorpor
hi
person
desir
to
have
enorm
amount
of

want
to
be

veri
power
and
veri
,
veri
rich
and
marri

''
,
he
'll
soon
learn
that
the

is
in
the
detail
.

for
exampl
,
-lrb-
and
we
've
seen
thi
sever
time
in
the
trailer
-rrb-
,
he
is
grant

,
but
find
out
that
he
's
a
columbian
drug
lord
and
that
allison
,
while

,
ha
her

appar
,
the
devil
is
just
as
eager
to
skew
hi
fantasi
as
she
is
to
possess
hi
soul
.

hi
other
wish
also
end
up
with
some
strang
but
funni
twist
that
short-circuit
hi
new
life
.

soon
,
elliot
wish
that
he
had
never
made
that
deal
.

given
the
mischiev
natur
of
the

,
``

ha
mani

a
lot
of
the
credit
goe
to
fraser
who
turn
in
a
great
comic
perform
.

he
abli
assum
variou
persona
.

hi
funniest
segment
is
when
he
wish
that
he
could
be
the
most
sensit
man
in
the
world
.

allison
becom
so
frustrat
with
him
that
she
practic
urg
him
to
take
advantag
of
her
.

hurlei
also
heighten
the
humor
quotient
,
especi
in
the
transit
scene
when
fraser
wait
to
start
hi
next
wish
after
bail
out
of
the
previou
on
.

it
's
clear
that
she
's
have
a
good
time
with
it
all
.

yet
,
while
the
filmmak
work
hard
at
creat
funni
scene
,
thei
conspicu
avoid
develop
the
allegor
underpin
between
good
and
evil
that
could
have
ad
more
heft
to
thi
stori
.

but
that
would
be
plai
with
fire
.

what
thei
've
got
work
,
so
you
can
easili
accept
it
for
the
pleasant
littl
comedi
that
it
is
.
