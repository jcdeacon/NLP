it
's
terribl
unfortun
that
``
stir
of
echo
,
''
tautli
written
and
direct
by
david
koepp
-lrb-
who
made
on
of
1996
's
unsung
treasur
,
``
the
trigger
effect
''
-rrb-
,
should
be
releas
littl
more
than
a
month
after
``
the
sixth
sens
,
''
which
is
still
go
strong
at
the
box
offic
.

these
two
film
ar
undoubtedli
go
to
be
compar
-lrb-
judg
from
practic
all
of
my
fellow
audienc
member
last
night
-rrb-
,
and
although
thei
have
eerili
similar
storylin
,
``
stir
of
echo
''
is
more
of
a
straightforward
psycholog
horror
film
,
while
``
the
sixth
sens
''
is
closer
to
a
psycholog
drama
.

addition
,
while
``
the
sixth
sens
''
had
a
shocker
of
an
end
that
undoubtedli
ha
been
on
of
the
major
factor
in
it
recent
repeat
busi
,
``
stir
of
echo
''
is
more
convent
and
predict
in
it
final
twist
.

and
where
``
the
sixth
sens
''
wa
disturb
,
``
stir
of
echo
''
is
just
plain
scari
.

i
have
a
feel
most
viewer
ar
go
to
come
awai
unimpress
becaus
of
the
unavoid
similar
,
and
will
foolishli
forget
to
judg
thi
film
on
it
own
respect
merit
.

adapt
from
a
novel
by
richard
matheson
that
wa
written
some

a

the
onli
wai

``
stir
of

''
is
n't
a
perfect
film
by
ani
stretch
of
the
imagin
,
but
in
the
thick
,
atmospher
mood
it
conjur
up
,
it
is
a
terrif
eeri
domest
horror-drama
,
and
is
not
onli
effect
on
a
technic
level
,
but
is
impress

it
portray
of
a
struggl
work-class
famili

bacon
and
erb
ar
not
tradit
hollywood
star
like
tom
cruis
and
julia
robert
,
and
therefor
,
ar
easier
to
relat

and
alwai
plausibl
as
a
struggl
coupl
who
have
to
work
overtim
at
their

just
to
make

in
a
masterfulli-done
,
entranc

,
tom
is
hypnot
by
lisa
,
but
instead
of
watch
him
,
we
instead
see
what
he
see
,
start
from
hi
view
as
he
close
hi

into

.

lisa
tell
him
to

and
so
,
we

ar
watch
a

from
insid
a

,
which
is
also
show
a
movi

tell
him
to
move
closer
and
closer
to
the
screen
as
a
fuzzi
word
in
black
letter
pop
up
on
the
screen
,
we
begin
to
float
closer
and
closer
to
the
front
of
the
theater
until
we
see
that
the
word
is
``
sleep

never

funni

dougla
get
to
utter
the
best
line
in
the
film
:
while
talk
to
maggi
about
tom
's
vision
of
the
girl
,
she
remark
,
``
i
would
n't
be
worri
about

although
the
fact
that
she
's
dead
give
on
paus
.
''

also
of
note
ar
jenni
morrison
-lrb-
1994
's
``
intersect
''
-rrb-
,
who
is
truli
poignant
in
the
last
half
of
the
film
when
we
flash
back
to
see
what
realli
happen
to
her
miss
charact
,
and
liza

remark
in
1998

``

,
successfulli
compliment
and
foreshadow
the
off-kilter
frame-of-mind
that
tom
is
put
into
,
and
director
david

prove
onc
again
that
he
is
a
director
with
a
knack
for
creat
almost
unbear

situat
that
revolv

realist-written
charact
.

``
stir

''
is
n't
as
good
as
``
the
sixth

''
but
why
should
it
need
to
be
?

both
