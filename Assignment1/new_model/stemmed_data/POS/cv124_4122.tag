the
project
thei

is
the

for
hy
's

,
finn
-lrb-
winona
ryder
-rrb-
,
who
ha
just

she
's
spend
the
summer
with
hy
and
gladi
,
and
awai
from
her
fianc
,
to
decid
whether
a
lifelong
commit
is
realli
what
she
want
,
and
whether
it
's
better
to
marri
a
friend
or
a
lover
.

on
of
the
greatest
pleasur
of
how
to
make
an
american
quilt
come
from
watch
an
arrai
of
fine
perform
by
an
impress
ensembl
cast
.

from
winona
ryder
,
ann
bancroft
,
ellen
burstyn
,
and
maya
angel
to
minor
player
like
rip
torn
,
clair
dane
,
and
kate
capshaw
,
thi
film
is
overflow
with
realiz
talent
.

the
perform
ar
good
enough
,
in
fact
,
to
cover
up
mani
of
the
script
's
weak
.

how
to
make
an
american
quilt
is
basic
an
unremark
,
if
affect
,
tale
of
love
across
the
gener
--
a
sort
of
truncat
american
version
of
the
joi
luck
club
,
with
a
dash
of
fri
green
tomato
ad
.

there
ar
probabl
too
mani
charact
.

so
,
instead
of
realli
get
to
know
a
few
of
them
,
we
ar
present
with
quick
glimps
into
a
singl
defin
event
in
each
of
their
live
.

we
learn
about
the
root
of
the
smolder
resent
between
gladi
and
hy
,
and
ar
told
the
reason
why
emma
stai
with
her
husband
and
sophia
is
so
irasc
.

there
ar
other
episod
as
well
:
the
love
of
anna
's
life
,
marianna
's
soul
mate
,
and
a
look
at
the
reason
why
constanc
enter
into
an
affair
with
her
friend
's
husband
.

the
sum
total
of
these
tale
is
meant
to
provid
the
framework
for
finn
's
stori
:
whether
to
go
forward
with
her
marriag
or
dalli
with
a
hunki
stranger
.

there
is
no
emot
epiphani
in
how
to
make
an
american
quilt
.

the
stori
ar
all
well-told
,
but
it
's
difficult
to
realli
connect
with
the
charact
--
their
moment
pass
so
quickli
.

while
we
certainli
feel
someth
for
each
of
the
eight
princip
,
our
emot
invest
is
tenuou
.

there
is
n't
enough
depth
to
pull
the
viewer
in
all
the
wai
,
and
mani
of
the
person
and
relationship
feel
half-form
,
like
a
quilt
with
patch
miss
.

to
put
it
bluntli
,
while
i
enjoi
watch
thi
film
,
it
did
n't
``
do
much
''
for
me
.

on
the
whole
,
how
to
make
an
american
quilt
is
a
nice-underst
drama
that
ha
a
lot
to
sai
about
love
,
passion
,
and
monogami
in
relationship
.

finn
's
segment
is
by
far
the
most
compel
,
becaus
she
's
the
focal
point
:
her
action
ar
shape
by
everyon
els
's
experi
.

the
other
patch
of
thi
american
quilt
ar
success
onli
to
vari
degre
.

if
there
's
a
disappoint
here
,
it
's
that
the
script
doe
n't
have
more
reson
,
but
the
privileg
of
see
such
a
fine
cast
in
top
form
allow
a
viewer
to
enjoi
thi
pictur
even
if
the
stori
is
somewhat
