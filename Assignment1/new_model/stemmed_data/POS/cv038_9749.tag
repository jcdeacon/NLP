or
``

''
.

some
peopl
simpli
call
it
``

.

a
life

is
sure
to
bring
about

,
a
life
less
ordinari
ha
everyth
from
claymat
to
profan
angel
to
a
karaok-base
music
dream
sequenc
.

whew
!

anyon
in
their
30
's
or
abov
is
probabl
not
go
to
grasp
what
can
be
enjoi
about
thi
film
.

it
's
somewhat
silli
,
it
's
somewhat
outrag
,
and
it
's
definit
not
your
typic
romanc
stori
,
but
for
the
right
audienc
,
it
work
.

a
lot
of
hype
ha
been
surround
thi
film
due
to
the
fact
that
it
come
to
us
from
the
same
team
that
brought
us
trainspot
.

well
sorri
folk
,
but
i
have
n't
seen
trainspot
so
i
ca
n't
realli
compar
.

whether
that
work
in
thi
film
's
favor
or
not
is
beyond
me
.

but
i
do
know
thi
:
ewan
mcgregor
,
whom
i
had
never
had
the
pleasur
of
watch
,
definit
charm
me
.

he
wa
great
!

cameron
diaz
's
charact
wa
uneven
and
a
bit
hard
to
grasp
.

the
audienc
mai
find
it
difficult
to
care
about
her
,
thu
discourag
the
hope
of
see
her
unit
with
mcgregor
after
we
ar
immedi
suck
into
care
about
and
identifi
with
him
.

misguid

a
life
less
ordinari
wa
a
delight
and
even
had
a
bonu
for
me
when
i
realiz
it
wa
film
in
my
hometown
of
salt
lake
citi
,
utah
.

thi
wa
just
on
more
thing
i
did
n't
know
about
thi
movi
when
i
sat
down
with
a
five
dollar
order
of
nacho
and
a
three
dollar
coke
.

mayb
not
know
the
premis
behind
thi
film
made
for
a
pleasant
surpris
,
but
i
think
even
if
i
had
known
,
i
would
have
been
just
as
happi
.

a
life
less
ordinari
is
quirki
,
eccentr
,
and
downright
charm
!

not
for
everyon
,
but
a
definit
chang
of
pace
for
your
typic
night
at
the
movi
.
