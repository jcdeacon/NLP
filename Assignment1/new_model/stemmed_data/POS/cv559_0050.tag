or
lot
of
blood
&
gut
,
men
against

and
mano-et-mano
stuff
.

in
other
word
,
it
's
a
walter
hill
film
!

with
a
john
miliu
script
!

i
alwai
pictur
these
gui
get
togeth
and
produc
a
movi
between
arm-wrestl
match
.

these
film
alwai
contain
male
charact
i
have
a
veri
hard
time
identifi
with
,
probabl
due
to
the
likelihood
that
ani
meet
between
them
and
me
would
result
in
my
arm
be
rip
off
and
then
my
subsequ
death
by
beat
with
said
limb
.

and
we
got
tough
gui
galor
,
here
;
drug-run
bandito
by
the
dozen
,
all
dirti
and
sweati
and
pretti
ill-temper
,
overal
;
a
secret
task
forc
of
armi

ar
in

ani
connect
between
the
govern

the
drug
runner
;
and
lot
of
shit-kick
texa
dirt
farmer
who
'd
as
soon
shoot
you
between
the
ey
as
look
at

in

,
michael

as
to
women
...
well
,
i
've
never
seen
jane
fonda
or
meryl
streep
in
a
walter
hill
film
,
and
at
thi
rate
,
i
doubt
i
ever
will
.

women
exist
here
to
look
good
,
comfort
the
man
,
and
get
argu
over
.

gosh
!

just
like
the
old
dai
...
frankli
,
thi
is
a
pretti
good
movi
,
if
you
can
accept
the
premis
and
can
take
the
macho
stuff
.

the
cinematographi
is
excel
,
the
cast
of
charact
is
broad
and
ha
textur
,
the
script
is
quit
good
,
and
the
film
let
you
keep
up
with
what
's
happen
yourself
,
without
spell
it
out
to
you
.

i
appreci
a
film
that
make
me
have
to
think
to
keep
up
.

final
,
there
's
lot
of
sam
peckinpah
slow-motion
shoot-up
.
