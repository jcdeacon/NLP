left
me
rell
from
the
theatr
,
stagger
from
the
relentless
assault
of
an

revel
in

craft
.

at
nearli
three
and
a
half
hour
,
magnolia
will
strike
some
as
a
brute
of
a
film

it
not

but
challeng
you
to
grasp
the
signific
of
seemingli
unrel

hidden
intent
.

it
is
deliri

depress

it
's
also
a

director
paul
thoma
anderson
take
a
talent
cast
,
wrap
them
in
a
net
of
interrel
stori
and
set
them
spin
in
a
symphoni
of
despair
whose
song
doe
n't
let
up
until
an

hover
over
all
these
charact
is
a
cloud
of
death
,
li
and
despair
.

it
is
not
a
pleasant
movi
.

there
is
not
on
bad
note
in
the
act
.

it
is
affect
and
layer
and
wonder
.

there
is
a
moment
where
tom
cruis
wordlessli
implod
that
rival
work
he
ha
done
in
whole
film
.

then
he
top
himself
with
a
mesmer
deathb
scene
.

walter
plai
her
charact
with
red-ei
raw
and
a
fierc
self-destruct
that
is
anxieti
induc
.

robard
convincingli
portrai
a
fade
whisper
of
a
man
,
who
still
hear
a
lion
's
roar
when
he
speak
.

director
anderson
ha
appar
given
the
actor
lattitud
to
emot
.

the
problem
is
that
he
stai
on
them
too
long
.

juliann
moor
's
charact
,
linda
,
quickli
escal
to
a
frenzi
pitch
of
guilt
,
tear
,
scream
and
remors
and
never
back
off
from
it
.

after
a
few
hour
,
it
turn
from
interest
to
chines
water
tortur
.

quit
a
few
scene
,
such
as
the
game
show
,
go
on
just
a
bit
too
long
and
will
be
off-put
for
those
us
to
a
patminut
film
where
the
main
theme
is
reiter
sever
time
just
in
case
you
miss
it
the
first
go
around
.

and
just
what
is
the
theme
?

alien
?

hopeless
?

anderson
challeng
you
to
draw
your
own
conclus
and
he
doe
n't
make
it
easi
.

the
film
start
by
show
three
,
strang
and
seemingli
unrel
event
.

it
's
a
harbing
of
the
synchron
to
come
.

at
time
,
differ
stori
reach
reach
kei
moment
at
the
same
time
.

other
time
,
stori
seem
to
veer
off
into
unchart
territori
,
regardless
of
what
els
is
happen
.

anderson
is
audaci
enough
to
even
have
a
group
sing
in
the
middl
of
the
film
!

what
's
surpris
is
that
it
mostli
work
.

if
you
have
doubt
about
anderson
's
intent
,
i
'll
ask
you
to
pai
attent
to
the
final
frame
.

despit
all
the
sturm
und
drang
,
magnolia
ultim
speak
to
man
's
capac
for
hope
and
attempt
at
redempt
.

despit
magnolia
's
needlessli
long
run
time
and
it
propens
for
uneven
edit
as
anderson
plai
the
auteur
,
show
off
fro
the
mass
,
i
have
to
admir
hi
gut
.

thi
is
truli
adventur
filmmak
that
spit
in
the
face
of

a
side
note
:
help
anchor
the
film
is
a
perfectli
match
soundtrack
featur
aime
mann
.

her
lyric
often
add
depth
to
a
scene
themat
while
the
actual
music
is
both
moros
and
beauti
.

when
she
sing
``
save
me
''
at
the
end
,
it
enhanc
the
yearn
felt
by
the
charact
,
just
as
``
wise
up
''
mirror
the
anguish
felt
by
all
as
thei
contempl
their
live
.
