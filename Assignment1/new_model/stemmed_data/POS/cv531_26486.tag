it

thi

god

he

whose

ar
at

,
jeann
rais
an

and
march
toward
the

wall
.

after
thi
the
film
stai
mostli
on
the
battlefield
,
where
besson
demonstr
hi
abil
to
direct
amaz
action
sequenc
,
onli
occasion
resort
to
a
calmer
tempo
.

the
movi
is
fill
with
dreami
,
symbol
imag
of
pure
artist
craftsmanship
,
that
creat
a
surreal
and
occasion
paranoiac
atmospher
.

the
film
is
lost
in
time
and
space
,
hyster
jump
back
and
forth
in
jeann
's
thought
,
imagin
and
conscienc
.

besson
's
visual
style
permit
the
audienc
to
enter
the
mediev
ag
,
feel
the
smell
of
fresh
blood
and
the
adrenalin
pump
in
your
bodi
in
the
heat
of
battl
.

but
the
film
is
far
from
be
flawless
.

the
script
need
a
lot
of
polish
.

except
for
jeann
,
there
ar
no
real
charact
.

and
although
a
grand
star
cast
is
assembl
,
their
charact
ar
noth
more
than
prop
,
not
more
aliv
than
the
costum
that
thei
ar
wear
.

as
for
the
maiden
of
lorrain
herself
,
she
is
portrai
as
a
simpl
girl
,
too
small
for
her
divin
task
.

in
the
latter
part
of
the
film
,
we
see
her
as
hyster
,
confus
and
on
the
brink
of
mad
,
with
her
past
puriti
and
innoc
for
ever
lost
.

jovovich
handl
the
part
with
more
panach
than
on
might
expect
.

but
though
her
screen
time
is
incred
excess
,
both
malcovich
-lrb-
`
be
john
malcovich
'
-rrb-
and
dunawai
-lrb-
`
titu
'
-rrb-
surpass
her
rather
overact
and
simpli
unprofession
perform
.

and
even
hoffman
manag
to
breath
some
life
into
hi
dreadfulli
small
part
.

besid
cast
jovovich
,
besson
's
onli
mistak
is
hi
extrem
sens
of
patriot
that
in
the
end
ruin
hi
so
glorious
craft
paint
.

there
ar
some
viscous
evil
englishmen
that
murder
,
pillag
and
betrai
with
a
smile
on
their
face
.

and
some
incred
brave
and
nobl
frenchmen
,
repres
by
the
``
three
musket
''
of
thi
stori
--
the
brave
gill
de
rai
-lrb-
vincent
cassel
-rrb-
,
the
wise
aulon
-lrb-
desmond
harrington
-rrb-
and
the
strong
la
hire
-lrb-
richard
ride
-rrb-
.

though
all
those
actor
perform
well
,
their
charact
ar
noth
more
than
symbol
--
banner
that
proclaim
the
glori
of
franc
.

and
thu
,
there
is
no
sens
of
realism
in
thi
film
.

`
the
messeng
'
ha
muscl
instead
of
brain
.

there
is
some
relief
in
the
end
,
where
besson
lai
down
hi
armor
and
start
think
.

dustin
hoffman
's
appear
help
and
the
film
end
elegantli
and
surprisingli
effect
with
a
climax
worthi
of
prais
.

jeann
's
charact
is
unlock
,
but
whether
god
wa
in
the
pictur
or
not
,
is
never
quit
explain
.

wa
she
a
confus
peasant
girl
driven
by
her
own
hunger
for
reveng
?

or
wa
she
truli
a
messeng
of
god
?

the
film
pose
as
mani
question
as
answer
and
noth
is
complet
obviou
.

bess
o
messeng
'
is
noth
more
than
a
fairli
good
film
.

it
is
not
much
that
you
rememb
of
it
after
you
leav
the
theater
.

mayb
the
sound
,
the
dreami
sequenc
,
but
certainli
not
the
dialogu
.

it
is
an
eleg
and
adrenalin
pump
histori
lesson
for
the
mtv-gener
,
that
although
present
some
interest
materi
,
work
better
when
it
's
on
the
battlefield
.
