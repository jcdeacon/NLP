if
you
've
ever
perus
my
colleg
comedi
diari
``
anoth
year
in
the
life
of
a
nerd
''
-lrb-
i
never
run
out
of
cheap
plug
-rrb-
,
you
know
i
did
n't
get
along
with
my
first-semest
roommat
too
well
.

in
fact
,
dure
the
three-week
period
between
thanksgiv
and
christma
break
,
i
said
a
total
of
four
sentenc
to
him
.

so
when
i
saw
in
the
resid
hall
cabl
list
a
movi
call
roommat
,
i
envisionedminut
of
conflict
between
a
coupl
of
bicker
young
adult
trap
in
axfoot
dorm
room
.

then
i
saw
that
the
star
of
roommat
is
peter
falk
.

scratch
that
idea
.

but
i
still
sai
someon
should
film
the
stori
of
two
colleg
roommat
whose
relationship
is
less
than
ideal
.

of
cours
,
in
my
case
it
would
be
a
silent
pictur
.

even
without
the
colleg
element
,
i
still
decid
to
watch
roommat
becaus
i
had
absolut
noth
to
do
,
unless
you
count
studi
for
final
exam
-lrb-
and
who
doe
?
-rrb-
.

i
'm
glad
i
did
.

peter
falk
's
perform
wa
actual
what
made
the
movi
.

and
thi
is
a
gui
i
never
consid
a
real
actor
,
more
like
someon
who
went
around
in
a
trenchcoat
solv
prescript
mysteri
.

falk
pleasantli

earn
my
respect

live
to
insult
the

can
just
falk
