``
mai
not
be
''
toi
stori
,
``
but
it
's
more
close
than
''
antz
``
wa
.
''

i
realli
like
``
antz
,
''
basic
becaus
,
ye
,
it
is
clever
and
witti
and
intellig
-lrb-
and
it
ha
the
temer
to
take
a
chanc
and
put
woodi
allen
in
the
lead
,
perhap
the
year
's
most
inspir
cast
-rrb-
,
but
there
wa
,
in
fact
,
someth
miss
from
it
,
and
i
'm
the
first
to
admit
that
.

mayb
it
's
that
it
never
total
let
go
and
take
off
into
real
innoc
fun-it
's
too
obsess
with
it
orwellian
messag
to
becom
total
engag
,
and
if
it
were
n't
for
woodi
allen
,
it
would
have
been
just
a
realli
clever
good-not-great
flick
.

``
a
bug
's
life
''
ha
a
similar
premis
,
and
it
also
ha
disnei
to
insur
that
it
's
g-rate
and
not
total
over
kid
'
head
like
``
antz
''
wa
-lrb-
not
a
bad
thing
,
believ
me
-rrb-
,
but
what
it
also
ha
is
a
tone
that
's
complet
innoc
even
when
it
's
also
remain
perpetu
clever
.

``
antz
''
is
still
the
more
witti
film
,
and
i
love
it
for
it
,
and
``
a
bug
's
life
''
is
more
for
gener
consumpt
,
but
it
's
also
more
entertain
.

it
broaden
it
horizon
,
and
when
it
realli
move
from
the
ant
coloni
,
it
realli
show
us
a
whole
new
world
we
've
never
seen
befor
,
and
it
's
take
on
the
evolut
of
bug
is
a
lot
better
than
the
on
in
``
antz
.
''

it
's
also
light
and
clever
.

the
visual
ar
,
instead
of
earth
tone
,
bright
worldli
color
,
and
still
give
the
amaz
visual
technolog
of
``
antz
''
at
least
a
worthi
contend
.

the
charact
ar
also
nice
realiz-though
water-down
for
broad
consumpt
,
thei
still
carri
more
wit
than
the
contemporari
disnei
anim
film
.

the
lead
charact
,
flik
-lrb-
voic
by
dave
folei
-rrb-
,
is
noth
more
than
a
slightli-less
neurot
z
from
``
antz
,
''
but
folei
make
him
nearli
as
engag
as
allen
made
z.
instead
of
gene
hackman
plai
the
villain
,
we
get
the
much
more
menac
kevin
spacei
as
the
lead
grasshopp
,
the
nice-titl
hopper
.

and
for
the
romant
lead
,
we
do
n't
get
spacei
sharon
stone
,
but
intellig
and
hard-to-get
julia-loui
dreyfuss
,
who
doe
n't
even
come
around
until
the
veri
final
frame
.

not
that
the
plot
's
realli
ani
better
than
the
on
in
``
antz
''
-
it
's
basic
yet
anoth
redux
of
``
the
seven
samurai
,
''
with
an
ant
coloni
under
the
control
of
giant
grasshopp
forc
them
to
produc
a
product
for
them
or
els

when
