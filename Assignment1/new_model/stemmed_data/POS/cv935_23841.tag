reportedli
the
whale
,
as

on
an
imax
screen
in
certain
sequenc
,
ar
shown
as
actual
size
.

the
cgi
whale
look
incred
life-like
,
except
for
some
googli
cartoon
ey
drawn
onto
the

.

on
especi
strike

involv
the
giant

absolut
beauti
stuff
.

the
third
segment

and
the
least
of
the
eight
segment
-rrb-
is
set
to
georg
gershwin
's
``
rhapsodi
in
blue
''
.

thi
segment
is
design
as
a
tribut
to
acclaim
caricaturist
al
hirschfeld
,
and
intertwin
four
differ
stori
about
sad
soul
live
in
depress
era
new
york
.

there
's
a
construct
worker
who
dream
of
be
a
jazz
drummer
,
an
out-of-work
sad
sack
that
dream
of

,
and
a
nebbish
who
dream
of
be
free
from
hi
overbear
wife
.

i
wo
n't
go
into
how
everyth
work
out
,
but
in
fine
disnei
tradit
there
is
a
happi
end
.

unfortun
,
the
stori
drag
quit
a
bit
and
the
seem
out
of
place
within
the
hyper
realiti
of
the
rest
of
the
segment
.

segment
four
is
set
to
dmitri
shostakovich
's
``
piano
concerto
no.
2
''
and
is
an
anim
version
of
han
christian
andersen
's
``
the
steadfast
tin
soldier
''
.

a
on
leg
toi
tin
soldier
fall
in
love
with
a
wind-up
clock
ballerina
-lrb-
whom
he
assum
is
also
on
leg
becaus
he
ca
n't
see
her
other
leg
extend
out
behind
her
-rrb-
,
much
to
the
dismai
of
an
evil
jack-in-the-box
jester
.

the
jester
knock
the
soldier
out
of
a
window
and
continu
pursu
the
ballerina
.

littl
doe
the
jester
know
,
the
soldier
ha
been
deposit
in
the
sewer
and
ha
journei
through
the
pipelin
onli
to
be
swallow
by
a
fish
that
ha
been
captur
and
sold
to
the
owner
of
the
set
of
tin
soldier
that
the
on
leg
on
come
from
.

the
soldier
eventu
save
the
dai
and
get
the
girl
.

although
the
end
ha
been
alter
from
the
andersen
stori
,
``
the
steadfast
tin
soldier
''
is
decent
told
with
in
the
framework
of
a
seven
minut
short
.

some
children
mai
find
the
jester
to
be
a
littl
frighten
,
but
otherwis
the
segment
is
well
made
.

segment
five
is
the
funniest
of
the
bunch
.

set
to
camil
saint-saen
``
the
carniv
of
the
anim
''
,
thi
segment
featur
a
flamingo
tortur
hi
fellow
flamingo
with
a
yo-yo
while
thei
ar
try
to
perform
a
choreograph
danc
number
.

while
it
is
the
shortest
clip
of
the
group
and
a
throwback
to
the
allig
and
hippo
danc
in
the
first
fantasia
,
it
is
still
well
accomplish
and
a
welcom
bit
of
comedi
.

segment
six
is
the
onli
segment
to
be
repeat
from
the
origin
1940
fantasia
,
and
it
's
the
on
that
peopl
rememb
most
,
``
the
sorcer
's
apprentic
''
.

the
stori
is
the
most
recogniz
,
so
the
draw
here
is
see
it
on
the
enorm
imax
screen
in

unfortun

be

to

the
credit
for
a

more

from
martin
.

penn
and
teller
ar
usual
funni
,
but
here
their
gag
seem
routin
and
therefor
uninterest
.

the
best
segment
come
from
,
of
all
peopl
,
bett
midler
,
who
get
to
tell
us
about
some
of
the
abandon
segment
that
never
made
it
off
of
the
draw
board
.

piec
like
flight
of
the
bumblebe
,
a
take
on
the
four
horsemen
set
to
wagner
's
``
ride
of
the
valkyri
''
,
and
a
strang
segment
prepar
in
the
'40s
by
salvador
dali
that
never
wa
shown
ar
all
preview
here
and
teas
that
thei
mai
appear
in
futur
instal
.

for
fan
of
visual
stimul
or
classic
music
,
fantasia
2000
is
a
perfect
wai
to
spend
the
afternoon
.

the
film
is
also
decent
famili
entertain
and
contain
littl
to
no
objection
materi
.

as
i
mention
earlier
in
the
review
,
if
ten
dollar
seem
like
too
much
for
you
to
spend
on
thi
film
,
fear
not
becaus
after
it
run
in
imax
theater
it
is
go
to
be
brought
out
in
regular
theater
.

i
must
stress
that
the
best
wai
to
see
thi
film
is
on
an
imax
screen
though
.

then
you
too
can
believ
that
whale/triangl
thing/sprite
can
fly
.
