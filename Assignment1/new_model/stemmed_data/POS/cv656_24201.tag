the

so
that
i

now
the

,
my

both
film
ar
as
innocu
for

as

even
better
,
i
did
n't

look
like

us
an

as
an
excus

thi
mai
be

the

is
so

follow
a
small

who
swipe
the

solv
the

there

the

on
a
german
submarin
known
as
-lrb-
you
guess
it
-rrb-
u-571
.

it
is
now
up
to
the
mostli
young
and
inexperienc
sailor
,
led
by
an

matthew
mcconaughei
-rrb-
,
to
return
the
typewrit
to
america
without
get
sunk
by

the
film
start
off

with
a

as

it
doe
not
stop
and
luckili
,
becaus
it
is
so
excit
,
i
did
n't

thi
is
not

from

heart-pound

to
the

make

the

of

ar
when
