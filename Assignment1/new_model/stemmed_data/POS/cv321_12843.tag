the

it
start
with
andrew

who
creat
the

ten

.

the
stori
,

is
about

on-up
niccol
,
it
wa
when
unlik
candid-director
peter
weir
took
the
helm
that
thing
fell
into
place
.

weir
had
the
nearli

to
creat
the
unimit

deftli
mix

throw
georg

it
wa
weir
's

stroke
of

a

the

touch
ar
the

leav

.

credit
weir
for
hi
second
stroke
:
the
cast
of
carrei
.

carrei
seem
to
be
the
type
of
charact
actor
who
would
alwai
turn
``
on
''
and
act
goofi
whenev
the
camera
is
near

not
here
.

hi

so
subvert
you
sometim
wonder

and
although

better

it

laura
linnei
-lrb-
congo
-rrb-
and
noah
emmerich
-lrb-
copland
-rrb-
have
the
unfortun
task
of
plai
truman
's
wife
and
best
friend
;
their
sitcom-ish
dialogu
allow
littl
room
for
ani
authent
charact
develop
.

the
except
is
at
the
veri
begin
,
where
thei
speak
into
the
camera
,
wholeheartedli
believ
that
their
particip
is
truli
good
for
truman
,
and
for
societi
in
gener
.

there
ar
other
littl
problem
with
the
script
.

ar
we
to
assum
that
toddler
truman
had
no
recollect
of
hear
the
construct
of
such
a
gigant
dome
dure
hi
form
year
?

wa
there
ani
reason
as
to
why
in
on
scene
,
it
rain
sole
on
truman
,
even
though
it
never
had
to
?

how
is
it
thei
hire
hundr
of
extra
,
and
none
of
them
could
drive
a
boat
,
and
yet
truman
,
fear
of
water
,
is
helm
a
sailboat
effortlessli
?

and
could
n't
christof
have
turn
off
the
wind
,
to
strand
truman
at
sea
?

these
littl
contriv
,
howev
,
do
not
hold
a
candl
to
the
overal
effect
of
the
work
.

the
audienc
get
the
feel
that
it
is
watch
the
actual
show
,
and
we
ar
drawn
to
truman
's
mundan
exist
for
no
other
reason
than
it
is
there
.

the
final
result
effortlessli
combin
the
emot
happi
end
of
a
mainstream
pictur
with
a
gnaw
discomfort
that
hit
you
squar
in
the
gut
.

upon
leav
the
theater
,
i
wa
look
up
in
the
sky
,
wonder
if
it
wa
noth
more
than
a

just
