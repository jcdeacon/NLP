it
is
the

in
order
to
enter
thi
virtual

,
you
have
to
take
over
someon

becom

thi
is
call
concis
transfer
,
and
thi
is
part
of
the
tragedi
in
the
film
:
peopl
``
wake
up
''
in
unknown
place
and
strang
thing
start
happen
.

thei
start
to
doubt
in
their
own
saniti
.

these
innoc
peopl
pai
for
the
mistak
of
their
``
user
''
and
creator
with
their
saniti
and
their
live
.

it
is
a
frighten
realiti
;
the
fact
that
all
the
peopl
in
the
simul
-lrb-
the
program
link
-rrb-
ar
live
out
their

,
oblivi
,
not

thei
ar
puppet
in
someon
's
fantasi
.

with
an
appeal
-lrb-
``
blade
runner
''
-
type
-rrb-
of
detect
stori
,
thi
film
present
the
beauti
and
possibl
of
virtual
realiti
and
the
lurk
danger
that
is
alwai
present
.

our
modern
world
is
metal
and
glass
--
cold
,
unfriendli
,
imperson
.

the
thirti
ar
differ
--
color
,
beauti
,
eleg
,
viril
.

thi
contrast
demonstr
a
wish
for
chang
.

virtual
realiti
is
here
portrai
as
a
magic
,
enchant
power
that
seduc
you
into
it
endless
possibl
.

to
some
it
is
just
a
journei
to
their
person
paradis
,
to
some
a
person
playground
--
a
life
without
ani
consequ
.

for
other-a
wai
to
start
over
and
``
correct
''
their
mistak
,
by
live
in
an
illus
of
their
past
.

virtual
realiti
is
a
wizard
that
transform
your
hope
,
dream
and
fantasi
to
life
.

at
least
that
's
how
it
is
all
begin
.

but
when
you
're
wake
up
from
your
dream
,
the
real
world
seem
worthless
and
unreal
and
all
you
can
think
off
is
return
to
your
person
paradis
.

thi
,
almost
narcot
effect
,
soon
turn
into
confus
and
ultim
mad
.

some
import
and
interest
philosoph
question
ar
rais
--
what
is
real
?

what
is
thought
?

who
ar
we
?

if
these
were
answer
,
thi
film
would
be
the
greatest
scienc
fiction
ever
made
.

thei
ar
off
cours
not
answer
,
but
pose
in
an
intellig
manner
.

the
visual
aspect
of
the
film
is
on
of
the
kei
element
,
sinc
it
portrai
the
contrast
between
these
comput-simul
univers
.

kirk
m.
petrucelli
ha
done
a
marvel
job
with
the
recreat
of
the
thirti
with
it
glamour
,
grace
and
color
;
and
set
thi
world
in
opposit
to
our
own
--
an
almost
caricatur
recreat
of
the
nineti
.

there
ar
some
honest
and
decent
perform
by
an
almost
unknown
cast
and
harald
klose
's
moodi
music
score
that
is
at
in
right
place
at
the
right
time
.

a
rather
unusu
thing
about
`
the
thirteenth
floor
'
is
the
almost
complet
lack
of
special
effect
.

there
ar
no
cgi
anim
creatur
,
no
bullet
in
slow
motion
.

thi
is
a
more
philosoph
approach
,
remind
about
the
european
wai
of
filmmak
.

thi
is
off
cours
a
major
disappoint
to
the
audienc
that
is
us
to
endless
gunfight
and
mutat
amphibian
,
but
the
more
seriou
scienc
fiction
buff
and
'
dark
citi
'
-
fan
will
be
pleas
.

thi
film
is
interest
and
inspir
.

it
ha
everyth
existenz
doe
n't
,
but
it
lack
the
immediaci
and
intens
of
the
matrix
.

and
then
there
is
a
happi
end
which
,
like
in
'
dark
citi
'
,
complet
alien
it
from
the
rest
of
the
stori
and
context
.

the
plot
itself
is
not
as
origin
as
the
filmmak
want
us
to
think
,
sinc
thei
have
virtual
suck
out
all
inform
from
the
best
scienc
fiction
classic
,
includ
blade
runner
and
'
dark
citi
'
.

with
thi
in
mind
,
`
the
thirteenth
floor
'
doe
n't
make
an
oscar
candid
or
a
film
that
will
be
rememb
a
year
from
now
,
yet
thi
is
a
beauti
,
eleg
and
intellig
take
on
virtual
realiti
.
