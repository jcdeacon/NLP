charact
of
nobl
virtu
,
the
screenplai
and

,
is
not
the
place

,
``
anyon

world
could
look
up
and
see
the
same
thing

-lrb-
laura
dern
-rrb-
,
and
sever
mine
worker
,
the
four
ar
soon
bound
for
great
thing
.

octob
sky
is
a
skillfulli
craft
film
,
and
most
of
that
credit
must
go
to
director
joe
johnston
.

johnston
--
whose
career
in
the
film
industri
includ
everyth
from
direct
well-known
titl
like
jumanji
and
the
rocket
down
to
an
uncredit
role
as
a
death
star
trooper
in
star
war
--
certainli
know
what
he
's
do
here
.

he
mold
charact
which
ar
true
to
life
and
also
fun
to
watch
into
a
plot
that
is
straightforward
and
robust
.

he
doe
not
push
ani
barrier
,
but
instead
adopt
a
conserv
style
of
filmmak
which
enhanc
the
film
's
charm
.

hi
finess
bring
out
element
which
might
otherwis
be
lost
--
such
as
the
relationship
between
homer
and
variou
mine
worker
,
or
the
silent
struggl
between
homer
's
mother
and
father
.

the
cast
is
well
chosen
,
although
the
true
bright
spot
ar
the
support
role
.

laura
dern
-lrb-
jurass
park
-rrb-
lend
a
strong
perform
in
the
role
of
the
histori
teacher
,
give
the
boi
the
support
and
guidanc
thei
need
.

her
role
is
instantli
likeabl
.

chri
cooper
-lrb-
the
hors
whisper
-rrb-
,
as
homer
's
father
,
is
less
likeabl
--
even
downright
despic
at
time
--
but
hi
turn
here
give
graviti
to
the
movi
.

he
's
definit
a
drive
forc
in
homer
's
life
,
and
hi
more
human
moment
give
the
piec
a
certain
dynam
that
is
commend
.

the
script
is
gener
cheer
,
project
the
boi
'
endeavor
in
a
lightheart
manner
.

there
ar
moment
when
it
becom
predict
--
such
as
the
train
track
scene
--
and
there
ar
moment
when
it
sacrific
orgin
for
the
need
to
come
up
with
an
emot
plot
twist
.

it
highlight
the
essenc
of
youth
,
howev
,
and
for
it
except
job
at
thi
it
can
be
forgiven
other
misstep
.

octob
sky
should
be
a
success
with
audienc
.

although
it
doe
n't
have
the
appeal
of
current
teen
flick
like
varsiti
blue
or
she
's
all
that
,
it
certainli
hold
an
undeni
qualiti
that
older
crowd
will
lean
toward
.

it
's
a
welcom
chang
to
the
dramat

on
that
everyon
