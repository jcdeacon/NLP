the
set
is
a

where
a
lie

other
plot

ar
thrown
in

wayland
suffer
from
a
peculiar
kind
of
epilepsi
that
can
,
in

,
whom

the
foibl
and
fail
of
these
three
ar
brought
into
the
open
as
the
mysteri
around
elizabeth
's
death
deepen
and
it
becom
unclear
who
ha
the
upper

:
the
suspect
or
hi

.

deceiv
,
which
mostli
transpir
in
a
dimli-lit
room
and
involv
a
lot
of
smart
dialogu
,
ha
the
feel
of
a
david
mamet
plai
:
edgi
,
claustrophob
,
and
tens
.

the
atmospher
is
explos
,
and
some
of
pivot
moment
of

deceiv
ha
the
power
to
grab
an
audienc

unfortun
,
in
the
end
,
it
succumb
to
the
need
to
throw
in
on
last
,
unexpect
twist
,
and
thi
is
it
undo
.

for
,
while
thi
surpris
will
certainli
shock
most
viewer
,
it
also
stretch
our
credul
too
much
,
and
rais
more
question
than

.

it
's
onli
an
effect
wrap-up
if
you
do
n't
think
too
carefulli
about
it

of

,
the
film
as
a
whole
plai
fast
and
loos
with
realiti
and
logic
.

polic

total
ignor
and
it
's
almost
imposs
to
accept
that
ani

or
could
proce

thi
manner

but
the
real
focu
in
deceiv
is
on

not

some
of
the
