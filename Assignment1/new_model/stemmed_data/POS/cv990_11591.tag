introduc
the
film

at
least
it
doe
until
he
forget
what
he
wa
go
to
sai
and
give
up
.

the
dude
-lrb-
jeff
bridg
-rrb-
is
describ
as
the
``
laziest
man
in
lo
angel

possibl

although
he

.

when
he

toward
a

.

arriv

attempt
to
collect
monei
that
hi
wife
ow
them
.

even
wors
,
thei
urin
on
hi
rug
.

the
problem
is
that
the
dude
doe
n't
have
a
wife
.

hi
assail
realiz
that
their
target
is
a
differ
lebowski
when
thei
glanc
around
at
hi
apart
.

the
``

lebowski
-lrb-
david
huddleston
-rrb-
is
a
multi-millionair
and
hi
dude
live
in
two-room
squalor
.

the
next
dai

our
ragtag
hero
visit
hi

attempt
compens
for

.

the
carpet
is
import
to
him
becaus
it
pull
the
room
togeth
:
not
surprisingli
sinc
it
's
virtual
the
onli
object
there
.

when
he
's
deni
ani
monei
,
he
pick
up
a
replac
rug
off
the
floor
.

on
hi
wai

he
run
into
lebowski

trophi
babe
wife
bunni
-lrb-
tara

-rrb-
who
offer
to
perform
a
sexual
act
that
,
accord
to
rumor
,
is
on
of
bill

favorit
for
a
thousand

.

the
penniless

later
he
get

unexpect
phone
call
enlist
hi

in
be
the

to
deliv
a
ransom
to
bunni
's
kidnapp
.

thi
begin
the
trademark
coen
brother
crime-gone-wrong
sequenc
.

the
kidnapp
ar
imposs
inept
.

the
dude
and
hi
croni
ar
even
wors
.

everi
plan
goe
awri
.

you
can
almost
see
lebowski
's
brain
churn
in
slow
motion
as
he
tri
to
figur
out
the
clue
.

that
's
the
stori
,
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
doe
n't
much
matter
.

there
could
be
almost
ani
plot
and
the
film
would
be
just
as
entertain
.

the
narr
onli
exist
so
we
can
watch
the
offbeat
charact
and
the
quirki
predica
thei
fall
into
.

the
dude
's
bowl
buddi
walter
-lrb-
john
goodman
-rrb-
and
donni
-lrb-
steve
buscemi
-rrb-
look
like
peopl
you
'd
see
on
the
street
but
,
like
everyth
els
in
thi
film
,
thei
're
not
quit
what
thei
seem
.

walter
is
a
vet
as
stuck
in
vietnam
as
the
dude
is
in
the
sixti
.

everyth
that
happen
remind
him
of
a
situat
in
the
nam
.

when
a
fellow
bowler
cross
the
foul
line
but
wo
n't
admit
it
,
walter
pull
a
gun
on
him
until
he
mark
a
zero
on
the
score
sheet
.

donni
get
preciou
few
word
in
between
walter
's
scream
and
the
dude
's
rambl
.

when
he
doe
,
walter
shout
him
down
with
horrend
albeit
seemingli
unintent
bowl
pun
.

donni
is
``
out
of
hi
leagu
''
and
doe
n't
``
have
a
frame
of
refer
''
.

the
film
is
pepper
with
peopl
for
whom
the
term
``
charact
''
would
be
an
understat
.

the
big
lebowski
's
daughter
maud
,
an
avant-gard
``
vagin
''
artist
,
paint
while
swing
nake
in
a
leather
apparatu
like
an
s&m
mari
martin
.

the
kidnapp
ar
german
techno
nihilist
biker
.

bunni
lebowski
is
a
high
school
cheerlead
turn
porno
star
.

most
impress
is
john
turturro
in
hi
far
too
small
role
as
a
hispan
bowler
.

as
the
flamenco
music
swell
,
we
see
him
put
on
hi
lavend
hose
.

the
camera
pan
up
to
an
all-purpl
skin-tight
bowl
outfit
with
``
jesu
''
-lrb-
pronounc
with
a
``
j
''
,
not
an
``
h
''
-rrb-
embroid
on
the
pocket
.

he
address
the
lane
with
intens
serious
and
on
paint
fingernail
.

hi
tongu
slowli
snake
out
and
lovingli
lick
the
glow
bowl
ball
.

bridg
work
the
dude
as
if
he
had
been
live
him
for
decad
and
mayb
he
ha
.

i
ca
n't
think
of
anyon
els
who
could
have
done
a
better
job
.

buscemi
ha
a
limit
role
,
but
he
plai
it
perfectli
.

the
more
that
i
see
john
goodman
the
more
convinc
i
am
that
he
's
on
of
the
treasur
of
our
time
.

it
's
odd
to
think
that
most
of
the
world
know
him
onli
as
roseann
barr
's
televis
husband
.

more
like
the
coen
's
``
rais
arizona
''
than
their
hit
``
fargo
''
,
``
the
big
lebowski
''
demand
an
open
mind
and
even
more
open
ey
.

a
mark
of
the
coen
brother
is
that
even
with
all
wonder
dream
sequenc
and
the
broad
slapstick
physic
comedi
on
the
screen
,
much
of
the
humor
is
subtl
and
easi
to
miss
.

there
's
so
much
go
on
that
frequent
it
disappear
befor
you
can
see
it
.

walk
out
of
the
theater
,
i
felt
that
the
film
had
someth
import
to
sai
.

on
further
examin
,
i
wa
n't
sure
exactli
what
it
wa
.

``
if
you
meet
jesu
at
the
bowl
allei
,
it
's
not
go
to
be
what
you
expect
''
?

``
when
the
go
get
weird
,
the
weird
go
bowl
''
?

mayb
there
's
no
real
messag
.

perhap
it
's
just
a
roller
coaster
ride
through
a
hilari
world
.

mayb
that
's
enough
.
