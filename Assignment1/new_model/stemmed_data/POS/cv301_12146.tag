the
jekyl
and
hyde
stori
told
from
hi
maid
's
point
of
view
is
,
in
a
word
,
``
dark
''
.

you
would
n't
expect
someth
bright
and
cheeri
base
on
robert
loui
stevenson
's
novel
,
but
the
film
is
surprisingli
dreari
and
dismal
.

jekyl/hyde
-lrb-
john
malkovich
-rrb-
is
termin
depress
and
desper
.

mari
reilli
-lrb-
julia
robert
-rrb-
is
a
victim
of
monstrou
child
abus
and
the
anti-woman
sentiment
of
the
time
.

director
stephen
fear
'
version
of
the
london
slum
make
us
marvel
that
anyon
surviv
them
.

the
light
level
is
exceedingli
low
throughout
the
movi
:
it
almost
appear
to
be
film
in
black
and
white
.

the
direct
and
cinematographi
ar
brilliant
and
liquid
.

scene
flow
into
the
next
scene
like
honei
ooz
off
a
strawberri
.

-lrb-
except
there
's
no
red
,
of
cours
.
-rrb-

the
look
is
so
moodi
and
melodramat
that
you
'll
be
shock
when
you
leav
the
theater
.

i
saw
it
at
a
matine
and
took
quit
a
while
to
adjust
to
the
sunni
ski
afterward
.

often
the
jekyl
and
hyde
archetyp
ar
view
as
split
a
whole
person
into
compon
of
good
and
evil
or
perhap
cerebr
and
emot
part
.

here
the
doctor
is
intellectu
and
perhap
good
,
but
certainli
powerless
.

hi
alter
ego
is
forc
and
total
without
conscienc
.

two
part
that
make
up
a
whole
.

neither
ar
capabl
of
function
without
the
other
and
onc
separ
,
disast
is
inevit
.

the
differ
between
the
two
charact
would
be
more
effect
if
it
were
accomplish
by
demeanor
and
attitud
.

when
we
final
see
the
transform
,
the
special
effect
thrust
the
stori
into
the
realm
of
scienc
fiction
,
not
the
psycholog
horror
that
the
tale
demand
.

robert
and
malkovich
ar
skill
in
their
role
.

both
ar
suitabl
melancholi
,
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
the
film
.

the
onli
flash
of
life
and
color
come
from
glenn
close
-lrb-
and
her
lip
-rrb-
as
the
madam
of
a
whorehous
where
hyde

,
and
surprisingli

jekyl

life
and
color
mayb
,
but
thi
is
not
close
's
best
role
.

she
seem
littl
more
than
a
cardboard
cutout
charact
.

a
beauti
film
in
it
own
dreari
wai
.

you
'll
appreci
the
filmmak
craft
,
but
do
n't
expect
to
leav
in
an
upbeat
mood
.
