the
onli
basic
differ

,
leeloo
is
face
with
a
problem-why
should
she
save
a
peopl
who
live

the
question
is
a
good
on
,
and
on
that
could
be
ponder
.

but
enough
of
that
.

when
korben
point
out
hi

,
leeloo
is
inclin
to
becom
the
``

the
fifth
element
featur
good
perform
by
willi
and
holm
,
an
excel
portray
of
a
comed
villain
-lrb-
who
remind
me
a
lot
of
jack

's
the
joker
in
batman
-rrb-
by
on
of
the
master
of
villaini
,
oldman

,
ad
a

to
the

.

although
besson
's
the
fifth
element
can
be
critic
for
the
outlandish
us
of
clich
,
it
is
a
solid
motion
pictur
with
a
definit
point
.

some
