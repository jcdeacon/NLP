ru'afro
remind

somewhat

of

must
also
be
note
as

anij
,
who
picard
fall
in

murphi
is
not
a
young

with
a

bodi
;
she
is
a
matur
woman
with
an
attract

.

thi
is
the
type
of
woman
whom
picard
,
for
those
who
know
the
charact
well
,
would
be
enchant
with
.

in

,
the
chemistri
between
murphi

work
veri

for
as

surprisingli
disappoint

thei
prove

for

mainstream
scienc

,
but
thei
fell
wai
short
of
the
standard

pale
in

to
those
seen
in

the

in

,
seem
trite
and
unsuspens

and
the
final
confront
between
picard
and
ru'afro
took
place
on
a
complet

the

remain

despit
