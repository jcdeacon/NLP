earlier
work
includ
,
clerk
,
mall

.

chase
ami
and

.

so
,
be
advis
:
bone
up
on
that
cinemat
quartet
in
order
to
achiev
the
maximum
enjoy
from
smith

product
of
bluntman

chronic
,
comic

charact
base
on
the
two
jersei
slacker
.

jai
's
convolut
reason
is
that
if
the
film
is
shut
down
,
peopl
on
the
internet
will
stop
insult
him
and
bob
,
even
though
it
is
not
him
and
bob
the
peopl
ar
diss
,
but
rather
their
comic
book
counterpart
.

no
matter
,
the
duo
begin
their
long
trek
hitch
ride
across
the
countri
.

but
first
thei
get
some
tip
from
a
veteran
hitchhik
,
plai
by
georg
carlin
,
who
tell
them
to
follow
``

jai
and

contain
enough
laugh
that
the
movi
's
weaker
aspect-which
includ
a
lame
subplot
about
a

realli
,
how
can
you
not
laugh
at
a

the
movi
's
highlight
,
though
,
is
near
the
final
.

in
hollywood
,
jai
and
silent
bob
sneak
onto
the
miramax
lot
where
thei
crash
the
set
and
ar
mistaken
for
extra
of
the
latest
affleck-damon
pictur
,
good

.

here
we
ar
privi
to
a
hilari
convers
between
affleck
and
damon
in
which
the
two
put
down
each
other
's
career
and
film
choic
.

and
the
laugh
continu
to
grow
.

next
up
is
jason

of
the
star
of
that
legendari
featur

thi
bit
will
leav
you

obviou
affect
for

icon
is
evid
in
the
wai

he
