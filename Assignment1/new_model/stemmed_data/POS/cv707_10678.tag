publish
of
self-help
book

but
look
like
she
need
them
more
than
her
custom
,
as
she
is
lone
and
unhappi
.

roger
and
mari
-lrb-
hugh
lauri
and
imelda
staunton
,
who
were
also
marri
in
``
sens
and

-rrb-
ar
marri
,
and
ar
the
most
success
creator
of

but
have
suffer
a
tragedi
as
on
of
their
newli
born
twin
ha
recent
di
.

and
sarah

is
as
promiscu
as
ever
,
have
a
new

brian
-lrb-
toni
slatteri
-rrb-
who
's
marri
and
want
a
divorc
becaus
of
her
,
give
her
doubt
.

as
for
peter
,
thing
seem
okai
...
the
film
featur
lot
of
inner-friend
joke
,
and
even
some
old
theatr
anecdot
-lrb-
which
i
at
least
find
a
lot
of
fun
in
,
as
i
've
done
lot
of
theatr
myself
-rrb-
.

and
there
ar
big
confess
,
brawl
between
the
friend
,
and
by
the
end
,
almost
everyon
is
unhappi
,
even
though
some
have
resolv
their
problem
long
befor
the
end
-lrb-
which
i
kinda
dug
-rrb-
.

the
final
twist
would
seem
forc
an
anti-climact
,
but
for
some
reason
,
i
felt
the
same
wai
the
rest
of
the
friend
did
.

mayb
it
's
becaus
the
peopl
in
thi
film
ar
so
likabl
that
i
just
want
to
join
their
cliqu
.

that
's
realli
what
make
``
peter
's
friend
''
so
lovabl
:
the
wai
you
just
want
to
hang
with
a
group
of
friend
who
can
be
so
dysfunt
sometim
,
but
when
someon
's
in
crisi
,
can
come
togeth
wonderfulli
for
on
anoth
.

it
's
when
you
have
a
giant
crisi
like
thi
and
peopl
want
to
selflessli
help
you
out
instead
of
subt
push
you
awai
that
make
you
realiz
you
have
true
friend
,
and
these
peopl
ar
true
friend
.

not
to
mention
kenneth
branagh
is
abl
to
make
the
film
seem
nostalg
for
the
80s
-lrb-
a
decad
i
grew
up
in
,
unfortun
-rrb-
without
take
us
outsid
of
the
90s
.

there
ar
some
80s
classic
and
anti-classic
like
tear
for
fear
``
everybodi
want
to
rule
the
world
,
''
but
unfortun
no
stupid/fun
80s
song
-lrb-
i
think
if
i
ever
did
an
80s
reunion
film
,
i
'd
put
some
crap
go
go
song
on
,
or
at
least
some
good
old
``
come
on
eileen
''
-rrb-
,
but
thi
is
the
british
80s
we
're
talk
about
.

oh
well
.

but
anywai
,
the
direct
is
pretti
good
,
although
noth
amaz
.

branagh
's
fort
is
realli
make
shakespear
fresh
and
magic
,
but
at
least
he
's
veri
good
with
make
a
less
ambigu
film
like
thi
.

the
write
is
good
from
rita
rudner
and
martin
bregman
,
with
lot
of
good
on-liner
,
and
even
some
realli
bad
but
good
pun
-lrb-
to
mock
the
fact
that
andrew
live
in
l.a.
,
peter
,
while
cut
some
log
,
ask
him
is
he
ha
wood
in
l.a.
,
and
andrew
sai
,
``
no
,
but
we
have
hollywood
''
-
punish
like
that
-rrb-
.

the
actor
,
as
in
most
speak
movi
,
ar
better
than
their
materi
,
though
,
with
some
stand-out
perform
to
the
six
friend
,
as
well
as
the
outsid
like
slatteri
,
rudner
,
and
phyllida
law
as
the
old
housekeep
of
the
peter
's
mansion
.

a
littl
note
should
be
made
about
hugh
lauri
's
perform
,
as
he
look
like
he
took
some
massiv
dose
of
prozac
befor
do
thi-i
mean
,
i
've
never
seen
him
actual
act
thi
dramat
.

``
peter
's
friend
''
is
a
realli
enjoy
film
which
make
peopl
like
me
pine
for
some
sort
of
futur
reunion
,
although
i
do
n't
know
what
kind
i
'll
have
-lrb-
like
most
peopl
,
i
do
n't
look
forward
to
my
high
school
reunion
-rrb-
.

becaus
of
the
wai
these
friend
ar
still
abl
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
care
thei
have
for
on
anoth
and
after
such
a
long
period
of
seper
,
i
just
look
forward
to
the
dai
when
i
can
have
friend
like
that
.
