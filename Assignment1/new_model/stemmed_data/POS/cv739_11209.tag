there

no
need
to
fear
that
the

,
becaus
``
lebowski
''
is
an
effort
that
make
word
like
``

and
``

seem
like
an

sens
of
humor
,
the
film
is
a
smash
success
.

the

on

david

who
share

onc
the

realiz
thi
coincid
,
he
visit
the
big
lebowski
in
hope
to
claim
repar
for

it
seem
bunni

troubl
ar
relat
to
a
line
of
work
she
's
kept
secret
from
her

she

deserv
to
win
the

amount
of
acclaim
that

did
;
while
that
1996

certainli
a
better
film
,
``

is
at

the

boast
a
mile-high
absurd
level
that
sometim
threaten

the

keep
you
in

as
thei
unravel

and
must
be
commend
for
juggl
a
number
of
peopl
and
subplot
on
would
expect
to
find
in
a
robert

whether
we

``

there
ar
those
who
will
dislik
thi

hi

the

highlight
;
the

goe
for

,
whose
throati

is
a
hilari
hoot
.

john

mai

well
steal
the

with

.

sam

with
a
coupl
of
loos

and
some

quickli

and
never

these

forgiv

though

the

craft
a

so
rich

person
that
it
's
hard
to
look
at
the
final
product
with
anyth

a
big
grin
on

without
a
doubt
,
``
the

the
best
