wonder
life
is
on
of
the
few
pictur
of
time
gone
by
that
seem
as
fresh
,
mayb
fresher
,
then
it
did
when
it
wa
first
releas
.

mani
film
of
the
thirti
through
seventi
have
ag
poorli
.

but
thi
on
is
a
near
flawless
exampl
of
how
well
a
perfect
script
and
time
can
mesh
with
first-rate
act
,
wit
and
suspens
,
gloriou
music
,
and
terrif
set
peic
.

the
onli
even
slightli
date
scene
ar
those
at
the
begin
in
which
god
ha
a
long
chat
with
clarenc
,
georg
's
guardian
angel
.

thei
ar
n't
all
that
bad
,
but
thei
remain
corni
and
a
littl
out
of
place
.

nevertheless
,
thi
is
on
film
that
deserv
it
place
in
time
,
cinema
histori
,
and
our
heart
.

it
can
be
equal
appreci
by
anyon
of
ani

.

here
is
on
genuin
masterpeic
,
a
classic
that
reach
height
and
ambit
near
perfect
.

thi
crackl
good
mixtur
result
in
a
film
which
is
at
onc
funni
,
excit
,
move
and
uplift
.

the
film
itself
is
almost
a
revers
of
the
life
of
georg
bailei
--
there
is
n't
too
much
to
it
,
but
capra
and
the

to
it

potenti
.

the
result
is
a
film
--
though
not
at
first
intend
to
be
pigeon-hole
as
a
holidai
film
--
that
will
alwai
be
rememb
