new
life
into
the
buddi-action

-
to
the
tune
of
about
$
250
million
.

mess
with
success
,
so
the
team
is
back
again
,
and
better
,
in
``

.
''

the
combo
of
the
terrif
physic
talent
of
chan
and
the
non-stop
motor
mouth
of
tucker
made
for
an
ethnic
unusu
duet
in
``
rush
hour
''
that
plai
well
to
audienc
around
the
world
.

the
formula
work
so
well
,
in
fact
,
that
the
sequel
wa
inevit
.

i
'm
never
thrill
with
the
idea
of
a
follow-up
to
a
success
origin
sinc
thei
rare

wast
no

get
down
to
busi
and
turn
out
to
be
better
than

in
the
first

-rrb-
,
wast
no

get
to
the
point
right
from
the
start
.

the
maker
of
``
rush
hour
2
''
ar
work
at
a
distinct
advantag
over
the
origin
.

we
,
the
viewer
,
ar
familiar
with
the
two
lead
charact
and
the
alreadi-exist
chemistri
that
chan
and
tucker
develop
so
well
the
first
time
around
.

that
chemistri
wa
a
high
point
-lrb-
and
probabl
the
save
point
-rrb-
befor
and
,
now
,
the

wear
their

littl

we
like
best
in
``

''

first
and
foremost
to
me
,
in
``

,
''
is
the
immens
pleasur
in
watch
jacki

,
for
the
final
,
in
a

like
harold

chan
take
pride
in
put

self
on

the
combo
of

fist
with
tucker
's
fast
mouth
make
a
duet
more
endear
than
