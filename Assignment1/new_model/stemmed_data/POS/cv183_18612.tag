the
thirteenth
floor
,
the
third
in
what
i
would
call
``
the
realiti
check
movi
seri
''
,
is
veri
similar
to
the
other
realiti
check
movi
releas
thi
year
,
the
matrix
and
existenz
.

all
three
made
you
think
,
made
you
wonder
what
is
real
,
what
is
n't
,
and
if
our
world
is
just
a
huge
game
.

the
thirteenth
floor
doe
n't
reach
the
level
of
origin
,
creativ
,
and
curios
spark
by
the
matrix
and
existenz
,
but
it
certainli
give
a
great
shot
at
it
.

in
the
matrix
,
we
were
told
that
the
human
ar
simpli
a
viru
.

in
existenz
,
we
learn
that
our
life
could
be
just
a
game
.

in
the
thirteenth
floor
,
we
learn
that
we
ar
just
electron
devic
,
live
under
anoth
world
of
electron
devic
.

there
is
just
on
world
on
top
of
anoth
,
and
everyth
in
them
ar
fake
and
electron
gener
.

the
thirteenth
floor
took
a
huge
,
riski
turn
that
i
did
n't
expect
it
to
take
,
and
i
'm
not
veri
sure
it
wa
such
a
great
turn
to
make
.

rather
than
focus
just
on
the
realiti
part
of
the
film
,
the
thirteenth
floor
becom
a
murder
mysteri
that
end
up
ty
in
with
the
differ

the
simul
of
1937
is
just
like
it
wa
back
in
the
olden
dai
.

all
of
the
peopl
involv

just

the
thirteenth

is
a
plot
driven
movi
from
the
time
the
film
get
go
,
and
doe
n't
us
spectacular
special
effect
and
big
sound
to
keep
the
viewer
's
interest
.

i
wa
worri
that
thi
film
would
be
too
much
like
the
matrix
and
existenz
,
and
i
would
n't
enjoi
it
,
but
there
were
enough
twist
and
turn
to
keep
me
think
and
attent
to
the
film
.

unfortun
,
mani
potenti
would
have
been
great
scene
were
thrown
awai
with
predict
content
,
let
the
viewer
know
the
outcom
of
the
scene
long
befor
it
happen
.

the
scene
that
ar
n't
origin
or
interest
seem
to
go
absolut
nowher
,
leav
you
wonder
,
``
what
is
the
point
of
thi
?
''

sometim
it
wa
hard
to
believ
that
thi
stori
,
with
terribl
dialogu
,
some
bad
act
,
especi
from
craig
bierko
,
and
scene
that
go
absolut
nowher
,
ar
actual
true
.

i
know
thi
is
n't
a
true
stori
or
anyth
,
but
a
film
should
be
abl
to
make
you
think
that
it
is
.

on
the
plu
side
of
act
,
we
get
to
see
the
miss
from
main
charact

in

he
is

creat

not

do
n't
expect
the
intens
of
the
matrix
or
existenz
to
come
out
of
the
thirteenth

,
just
expect
anoth
film
that

and
shut
you
down

but
you
will
just
get
anoth
trip
to
send
your
