rosalba
is
bother
by
sever
surreal
dream
dure
her
time
in
venic
,
which
bring
the
movi
to
a
halt
.

it
's
like
put
a
gunfight
in

sever

after

probabl
becaus
soldini
want
to
includ
a
lukewarm

underdevelop
subplot
about

it
seem
more
like
a
desper
attempt
to
pump
up
the
drama
in
a
plot
that
doe
n't

but
there
ar
n't
a

the
movi
is
fun

romant
,
with
beauti

and
charact
whose
live
we
'd
like
to
live
if
we
had
