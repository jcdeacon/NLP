i
'm
not
quit
sure
what
to
sai
about
mar
attack
!

,
which
is
obvious
the
work
of
a
derang
geniu
.

when
tim
burton
's
twist
alien
invas
comedi
realli
work
,
it
's
breathtak
and
hilari
in
equal
measur
.

and
when
it
doe
n't
work
,
it
's
just
dull
.

i
'm
not
even
sure
it
work
more
often
than
it
doe
n't
,
but
where
it
count
--
that
is
,
when
thi
gleefulli
evil
invad
forc
from
the
red
planet
get
down
to
the
busi
of
blast
us
to
kingdom
come
--
mar
attack
!

is
brilliant
.

mar
attack
!

is
base
on
a
rather
unsavori
seri
of
trade
card
releas
by
topp
in
the
1950s
,
and
it
take
it
cue
from
the
same
sourc
as
thi
summer
's
independ
dai
--
old
alien
invas
flick
,
disast
movi
,
and
big-budget
special
effect
extravaganza
.

but
unlik
independ
dai
,
which
wa
a
painfulli
middl-of-the-road
appeal
to
the
heart
,
mind
and
wallet
of
america
,
mar
attack
!

ha
a
fulli
develop
and
veri
person
sens
of
wonder
about
it
.

the
big
differ
is
that
while
independ
dai
celebr
the
resili
of
human
be
,
mar
attack
!

portrai
us
as
the
greedi
and
hapless
schmuck
that
we
ar
.

the
titl
sequenc
is
just
splendid
--
an
incred
swarm
of
fly
saucer
rise
out
of
the
canal
of
the
red
planet
and
then
storm
earthward
through
the
solar
system
in
format
.

the
spin
metal
saucer
ar
dead
ringer
for
the
invad
forc
of
movi
past
,
and
their
first
appear
on
the
big
screen
in
combin
with
danni
elfman
's
thunder
,
theremin-driven
score
is
absolut
jaw-drop
.

it
's
so
overwhelm
that
,
i
swear
to
you
,
i
had
troubl
breath
.

the
movi
lai
low
for
the
nextminut
.

we
get
a
glimps
of
the
alien
leader
,
resplend
in
a
purpl-sequin
cape
,
when
a
televis
messag
is
broadcast
to
the
peopl
of
the
world
--
natur
,
the
onli
wai
to
commun
with
earthl
is
to
preempt
our
regularli
schedul
program
.

but
mostli
,
the
first
act
is
spent
develop
charact
,
set
up
mildli
comic
situat
,
and
draw
a
quirki
but
dishearteningli
drab
pictur
of
america
accord
to
tim
burton
.

it
's
a
good
thing
that
the
most
compel
person
in
the
movi
belong
to
the
alien
,
becaus
burton
's
just
not
interest
in

more
