where
their
awkward
is
express
in
a
scene
you
would
expect
in
ani
normal
offic

,
the
subject
of
the
dai
wa
cryogen
freez
that
enabl
the
charact
to
hop
between
two
time
period
.

here
,
it
's
time
travel
.

dr.

ha
thi
crazi
plan
to
steal
austin
's
mojo
-lrb-
the
sourc
of
hi
sexual
power
-rrb-
,
so
he
jump
through
a
time
portal
back
into
1969
when

chamber
.

there
,
he
emploi
a
grotesqu
600-pound
scottish
assassin
name
fat
bastard
-lrb-
also
myer
-rrb-
to
command
the
mojo
,
so
that
our
futur
hero
is
left
complet
shagless
.

meanwhil
,
austin
is
inform
of
evil
's
wrong-do
by
basil
exposit
-lrb-
michael
york
-rrb-
,
and
is
suppli
with
hi
veri
own
time-travel
devic
in
the
form
of
a
volkswagen
beetl
.

onc
back
in
1969
,
power
meet
a
foxi
cia
oper
name
felic
shagwel
-lrb-
heather
graham
-rrb-
,
and
learn
of
dr.

's
plan
to
destroi
washington
dc
with
a
lazer
on
the
moon
.

in
on
of
the
mani
uproari
jab
at
star
war
,
evil
call
the
moon
base
a
`
death
star
'
.

if
there
ever
wa
a
movi
that
knew
from
the
start
it
wa
a
complet
joke
,
it
's
austin
power
:
the
spy
who
shag
me
.

ap2
ha
mani
hilari
moment
,
much
more
so
,
than
the
origin
austin
power
.

but
what
it
doe
n't
have
is
the
confid
support
system
that
the
first
boast
,
and
the
joke
ar
now
more
scattershot
and
hit-and-miss
.

while
myer
ha
a
knack
for
deliv
clever
,
inspir
gag
,
he
sometim
doe
n't
know
when
to
call
it
quit
.

the
hilari
scene
in
the
origin
involv
mustafa
-lrb-
will
ferrel
-rrb-
and
hi
refus
to
die
is
plai
out
here
in
a
disappoint
and
tire
manner
.

robert
wagner
,
as
dr.
evil
's
#
2
man
,
ha
onli
on
scene
earli
on
in
the
film
,
where
he
lack
all
the
focu
of
the
charact
.

on
nice
surpris
is
rob
low
,
as
the
young
#
2
,
who
pattern
wagner
's
voic
and
movement
right
down
to
a
tee
.

there
ar
more
recycl
joke
from
the
predecessor
,
includ
kristen
johnston
as
ivana
humpalot
-lrb-
an
unfunni
rendit
of
alotta
fagina
-rrb-
.

but
myer
ha
clearli
put
so
much
dedic
into
thi
project
,
and
mani
bit
ar
side-splittingli
funni
.

do
n't
miss
an
extend
visual
gag
in
a
tent
,
where
the
shadow
leav
much
to
the
imagin
...
.

of
the
new
charact
,
graham
doe
n't
leav
much
of
an
impress
.

her
perform
is
mere
okai
,
and
she
lack
the
gung-ho
enthusiasm
that
made
elizabeth
hurlei
so
enjoy
befor
her
.

and
as
for
fat
bastard
...
well
,
he
provid
on
or
two
hilari
moment
,
but
all
of
the
obes
joke
and
bathroom
talk
go
too
far
.

but
my
most
sever
complaint
:
mr.
bigglesworth
wa
onli
in
on
scene
!!

but
,
with
grit
teeth
,
i
manag
to
get
over
that
.

thi
sequel
will
not
leav
fan
disappoint
;
it
's
more
often
than
not
a
laugh
riot
.

and
,
i
look
optimist
to
the
futur
,
where
i
forese
more
instal
to
the
austin
power
collect
.

if
myer
can
up
the
quota
of
fresh
idea
,
we
should
be
in
store
for
much
more
.
