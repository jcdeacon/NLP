mani
peopl
will
not
find
much
to
like
in
what
dream
mai
come
,
the
new
film
by
visionari
director
vincent
ward
.

most
will
come
to
see
the
comput
anim
landscap
and
vibrant
color
.

but
littl
do
thei
know
-lrb-
as
i
so
plainli
found
out
-rrb-
that
thi
ha
quit
a
complex
stori
to
tell
.

walk
out
of
the
theater
,
i
could
see
the
audienc
's
disgust
...
on
member
even
had
to
be
awaken
after
the
film
end
.

do
n't
believ
the
preview
that
you
see
...
thi
is
definit
not
a
film
for
everyon
.

thi
is
quit
possibl
on
of
the
most
adult-orient
film
to
come
out
in
recent
year
.

kid
will
get
bore
with
the
slow
plot
and
the
complex
storylin
.

the
plot
is
just
as
fluid
as
the
heaven
that
ward
present
to
us
.

it
goe
back
and
forth
in
time
,
as
if
it
ha
no
boundari
.

think
of
the
film
citi
of
angel
.

now
add
a
more
complex
screenplai
and
a
more
uniqu
vision
.

both
film
deal
with
the
afterlif
,
but
i
doubt
what
dream
mai
come
will
do
well
at
the
box
offic
.

cost
around
$
85
million
to
make
,
the
film
would
have
to
do
extrem
well
in
order
to
make
it
's
monei
back
.

but
due
to
it
's
stori
,
i
doubt
it
will
.

for
everyon
who
thought
titan
's
stori
wa
too
simpl
and
clich
,
here
is
proof
that
if
jame
cameron
had
written
a
more
complex
screenplai
,
it
mai
not
have
done
nearli
as
well
.

but
do
n't
get
me
wrong
...
i
hope
the
film
doe
do
well
.

it
's
a
vision
of
pure
viscer
enjoy
that
hardli
ever
get
put
to
the
screen
.

i
doubt
most
of
us
could
have
thought
of
thi
place
,
even
in
our
own
mind
.

what
dream
mai
come
is
the
second
best
film
of
the
year
when
it
come
to
visual
.

the
onli
film
that
surpass
it
is
dark
citi
.

full
of
rich
,
shock
color
,
we
get
to
see
a
heaven
that
most
of
us
would
probabl
die
to
get
to
.

but
do
n't
do
that
,
becaus
you
'll
end
up
go
to
hell
.

what

what
dream
mai
come
is
a
good
exampl
of
german
expression
which
mai
just
turn
off
a
good
portion
of
the
audienc
.

your
averag
movi
goer
more
than
like
is
n't
us
to
expressionist
techniqu
.

the
film
will
also
definit
draw
attent
from
religi
peopl
,
but
thei
should
n't
take
it
too
far
.

it
is
,
after
all
,
just
a
movi
.

robin
william
ha
continu
impress
with
hi
dramat
perform
,
while
hi
comed
role
have
been
suffer
.

hi
comedi
is
perfect
when
he
make
up
hi
own
stuff
,
but
when
is
confin
by
a
screenplai
,
he
is
n't
quit
as
effect
.

but
drama
is
realli
hi
strong
point
,
and
you
can
see
that
here
.

it
's
doubt
he
'll
get
anoth
oscar
nomin
,
but
i
would
n't
realli
mind
if
he
did
.

the
real
surpris
here
is
annabella
sciorra
who
impress
last
year
with
cop
land
.

thi
mai
be
her
breakout
role
and
mai
garner
her
some
much
need
attent
.

it
's
also
quit
possibl
that
she
could
get
an
oscar
nomin
.

howev
,
the
academi
doe
n't
like
to
award
perform
for
these
type
of
film
.

cuba
good
,
jr.
ha
been
better
,
but
he
's
certainli
not
distract
.

max
von
sydow
is
underus
,
as
ar
jessica
brook
and
josh
paddock
.

a
treat
for
some
movi
goer
is
to
see
werner
herzog
appear
-lrb-
if
thei
even
recogn
him
-rrb-
as
chri
'
father
lost
in
the
sea
of
face
.

it
's
not
hard
to
see
why
herzog
would
be
attract
to
thi
film
,
consid
he
think
that
audienc
ar
starv
for
great
imag
.

overal
,
it
's
william
and
sciorra
's
film
.

what
dream
mai
come
is
rate
pg-13
for
themat
element
involv
death
,
some
disturb
imag
,
languag
,
and
some
partial
nuditi
.

the
film
is
definit
aim
at
a
more
adult
audienc
.

some
will
find
the
plot
distract
.

some
will
find
the
visual
absolut
gloriou
.

and
some
will
find
both
.

the
onli
real
problem
with
the
film
,
that
i
could
see
,
wa
that
it
slow
down
consider
dure
the
midsect
,
just
after
we
have
been
immers
in
the
visual
and
befor
the
search
for
anni
begin
.

by
the
wai
,
some
controversi
even
surround
the
titl
,
which
wa
mistaken
for
a
sexual
term
-lrb-
``
what
''
becom
``
wet
''
and
you
should
understand
-rrb-
.

in
actual
,
the
titl
is
from
a
soliloqui
in
hamlet
.

just
thought
i
should
let
you
know
.
