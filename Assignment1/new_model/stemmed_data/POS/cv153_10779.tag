jack
nicholson
ha
a
funni
wai
of
plai
charact
with
veri
few
redeem
qualiti
,
but
whom
you
end
up
like
anywai
.

in
as
good
as
it
get
,
the
charact
in
question
is
melvin
udal
,
a
success
novelist
with
obsess-compuls
disord
who
seem
bent
on
have
as
littl
contact
with
peopl
around
him
as
possibl
,
except
when
he
feel
like
be
a
royal
pain
in
the
you-know-where
.

he
's
mean
.

i
mean
realli
mean
.

the
open
scene
show
him
shove
a
littl
dog
down
the
trash
chute
of
hi
manhattan
condominium
.

everi
dai
,
melvin
eat
at
the
same
cafe
,
sit
at
the
same
tabl
,
and
get
serv
by
the
same
waitress
.

you
can
tell
that
thi
is
hi
favorit
place
to
be
a
viciou
nuisanc
,
when
hi
waitress
carol
-lrb-
helen
hunt
-rrb-
tell
him
he
can
just
go
sit
in
anoth
section
,
and
all
the
other
waitress
just
cring
.

on
dai
,
melvin
make
a
comment
that
goe
to
far
,
and
carol
,
genuin
hurt
,
come
down
on
him
like
a
ton
of
brick
.

at
that
point
we
find
that
she
is
not
onli
the
onli
person
who
can
put
up
with
him
as
a
matter
of
cours
,
but
is
also
the
onli
person
who
can
get
to
him
,
too
.

anoth
person
who
often
cross
melvin
's
sight
is
simon
-lrb-
greg
kinnear
-rrb-
,
an
artist
who
live
on
melvin
's
floor
.

asid
from
the
fact
that
he
live
near
the
terror
of
the
citi
,
simon
ha
the
ad
benefit
of
be
gai
,
make
him
a
prime
target
.

simon
's
friend
frank
-lrb-
cuba
good
,
jr.
-rrb-
,
also
gai
,
doe
not
fare
much
better
.

when
simon
walk
in
on
a
pair
of
men
rob
hi
apart
,
he
is
brutal
beaten
and
sent
to
the
hospit
,
and
frank
,
who
ha
grown
tire
of
see
hi
friend
take
the
verbal
abus
dish
out
by
hi
neighbor
,
intimid
melvin
into
watch
after
simon
's
dog
while
he
convalesc
.

thi
is
the
same
dog
melvin
had
earlier
shove
down
the
garbag
.

an
interest
thing
happen
when
melvin
take
thi
dog
in
:
melvin
get
to
like
the
dog
,
and
the
two
develop
an
attach
which
is
the
catalyst
to
melvin
's
soften
up
to
the
world
around
him
.

it
doe
n't
happen
overnight
,
but
throughout
the
film
,
he
bite
hi
tongu
here
,
care
a
littl
there
,
and
most
miracul
,
fall
in
love
.

on
of
the
best
element
of
thi
film
is
watch
melvin
try
to
express
feel
which
ar
not
the
usual
neg
on
he
so
often
share
with
other
.

he
's
travel
terra
incognita
here
,
and
it
show
.

good
perform
ar
turn
in
by
all
princip
player
in
thi
film
,
especi
by
nicholson
and
hunt
.

thei
plai
well
off
of
each
other
and
have
a
genuin
chemistri
which
make
it
a
pleasur
to
watch
them
on
screen
.

greg
kinnear
,
who
is
becom
known
for
hi
support
film
role
,
is
also
veri
good
at
plai
the
vulner
simon
.

he
give
a
short
monologu
about
what
it
mean
for
him
to
be
an
artist
,
and
deliv
it
with
such
inspir
and
convict
that
you
actual
get
to
feel
some
of
what
he
feel
.

cuba
good
jr.
perform
with
a
hype-up
level
of
energi
which
contrast
nice
with
that
of
kinnear
,
and
come
through
with
a
near
constant
comic
perform
.

the
screenplai
,
by
mark
andru
and
jame
l.
brook
,
is
clever
,
touch
,
and
funni
.

the
best
part
about
it
,
howev
,
is
that
it
is
fill
with
charact
we
care
about
becaus
thei
ar
actual
interest
.

melvin
is
a
man
we
ca
n't
quit
figur
out
,
but
whose
manner
and
quirki
qualiti
captur
our
attent
.

carol
is
a
work
woman
live
with
her
mother
,
try
to
take
care
of
a
child
with
a
debilit
respiratori
problem
.

simon
is
a
man
who
is
a
success
in
hi
circl
of
peer
,
but
who
is
still
not
accept
by
much
of
societi
.

combin
with
the
talent
of
the
actor
,
these
charact
make
the
film
.

the
on
notic
area
where
the
film
is
lack
,
howev
,
is
the
absenc
of
cuba
good
,
jr.
through
the
second
half
.

hi
charact
make
an
exit
which
is
suppos
to
be
temporari
,
but
the
film
end
befor
hi
return
,
leav
hi
relationship
with
simon
and
melvin
unresolv
.

i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
more
of
hi
charact
in
gener
,
in
addit
to
a
part
in
the
film
's
conclus
.

there
's
on
actor
,
who
will
probabl
not
be
recogn
by
ani
award
,
but
who
contribut
greatli
to
mani
of
the
movi
's
best
scene
and
who
deserv

thi
is
that
littl

.

he
plai
such
a
pivot

to
melvin
's
charact
develop

actual
serv
to
forward
the
plot
,
and
ha
some
absolut

that
it
is

he
