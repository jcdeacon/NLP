what
follow
ar
some
of
the
best
slap-stick
danc
routin
ever
.

the
music
is
superb
,
and
could
have
onli
been
made
better
had
the
produc
ad
patrick
hernandez
's
born
to
be
aliv
.

the
choreographi
at

wa
a
parodi
of
an
era
gone
by
,
for
exampl
,
the
bee
gee
and
their
stayin
'
aliv
.

it
is
nostalg
for
those
of
us
who
rememb
that
far
back
,
and
the
techniqu
is
a
clever
adapt
that
work
well
in
forest
gump
.

on
of
the
funniest
scene
is
when
the
gold
digger

and
dump
both
on
the
spot
,
even
express
violenc
and
anger
that
thei
gave
sex
awai
.

an
art-imit-life
poke
at
shallow
women
.

it
's
a
scene
that
's
an
approxim
parodi
of

,
will
identifi
well
with
thi
scene
,
if
he
ever
watch
the
movi
.

of
cours
,
the
script
would
n't
be
complic
enough
without
ad
molli
shannon
,
the
girl
next
door
who
ha
had
a
crush
on

thei
were

and
who
will

when

more
head-bop

,
will
think
wors
of

run

definit
an
snl
parodi
of
the
graduat
where
katharin

chang
her
mind
for

i
found
thi

a

howev
,
it
went
over
brandi

head
--
she
wa
born
seven
year

the

a
