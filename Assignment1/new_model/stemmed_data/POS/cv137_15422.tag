ha
a
differ
kind

connect

more
than
he
would
care
to
admit
-lrb-
hint
:
it

-rrb-
interest
in

,
he
find
work
at
the
local
fast
food
restaur
at
which
she
work
,
and
the
fun
goe
on
from
there
.

thi
movi
is
a
lot
of
fun
.

it
is
comed
on
two
level
,
as
a
romant
comedi
and
a
dark
comedi
.

the
romant
moment
ar
sweet
,
yet
not
sappi
.

on
of
the
more
poignant
moment
is
when
dorian
accompani
salli
to
lamaz
class
.

howev
,
the
dark
comed
moment
ar
more
memor
.

thi
is
also
a
tale
of
reveng
,
and
a
funni
on
at
that
.

the
father
of
salli
's
unborn
child
also
happen
to
be
a
marri
man
,
whose
wife
is
plai
by
catherin
o'hara

she
doe
a
wonder
portray
of
a
jealou
wife

is
target
the
person
who
had
an
affair
,
and
is
not
abov
get
other
peopl
to
do
her
dirti
work
.

-lrb-
my
apolog
if
thi
sound
cryptic
,
but
there
is
too
much
of
the
plot
to
give
awai
-rrb-
.

round
out
the
cast
ar
jake
busei
as
angu
,
dorian
's
overzeal
brother
and
daryl
mitchel
as
roi
,
dorian
's
trainer
at
the
fast
food
restaur
.

the
dialogu
is
sharp
and
not
fill
with
sappi
overton
,
even
with
the
romant
natur
of
the
plot
.

if
there
ar
ani
complaint
,
it
is
over
drew
barrymor
's
perform
.

while
she
doe
light
up
the
screen
,
there
ar
moment
when
she
doe
n't
seem
all
that
convinc
.

the
movi
wa
film
in
texa
,
and
most
of
the
charact
have
southern
texan
accent
.

drew
barrymor
's
accent
tend
to
come
and
go
-lrb-
luke
wilson
doe
n't
seem
to
have
thi
problem
-rrb-
.

as
well
,
she
seem
awfulli
agil
for
a
woman
that
is
eight
month
pregnant
.

still
,
thi
movi
is
on
that
will
pleas
mani
viewer
.

with
plot
twist
galor
and
hilari
dark
moment
,
thi
is
sure
to
entertain
.
