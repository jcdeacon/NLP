and
even
the
infam
``
ellen
''
sitcom
be
center
on
the
life
of
a
lesbian
,
the
movi
industri
too
seem
to
be
gain
more

more
homosexu
base
plot
line
.

the
birdcag
wa
critic
acclaim
,
as
wa
thi
year
chase
ami
.

then
along
came
in
&
out
,
and
all
three
of
these
film
ar
on
my
top
ten
list
for
the
year
in
which
thei
were
releas
.

it
's
also
notic
that
thi
``
altern
lifestyl
''
becom
less
and
less
taboo
as
the
year
go
by
,
and
it
seem
that
us
comedi
as
a
medium
is
prove
a
worthwhil
effort
.

while
it
's
a
veri
seriou
issu
to
mani
,
it
is
the
comedi
that
peopl
ar
flock
to
see
and
that
ar
gain
notorieti
.

but
the
wai
we
're
us
comedi
to
present
homosexu
is
also
chang
quit
dramat
.

while
the
gai
commun
wa
onc
veri
stereotyp
and
us
to
laugh
*
at
*
,
it
is
more
and
more
becom
someth
we
laugh
*
with
*
,
and
when
a
movi
like
in
&
out
come
along
,
it
is
someth
that
both
heterosexu
and
homosexu
should
be
abl
to
thoroughli
enjoi
.

it
doe
n't
poke
fun
at
the
lifestyl
,
it
simpli
us
it
to
all
it
's
comed
capac
,
just
as
love
,
sex
,
marriag
,
birth
,
death
,
and
anyth
els
ha
been
.

the
idea
for
in
&
out
wa
born
the
dai
tom
hank
won
hi
oscar
for
portrai
an
aid-afflict
gai
man
in
philadelphia
.

if
you
rememb
,
dure
hi
accept
speech
,
hank
gave
a
highli
emot
tribut
to
the
gai
commun
,
and
even
sight
a
former
gai
teacher
of
hi
as
a
major
inspir
in
hi
life
.

it
's
a
seriou
and
touchi
subject
,
but
produc
scott
rudin
view
it
as
the
set
for
a
potenti
hilari
comedi
,
and
pitch
it
to
screenwrit
paul
rudnick
.

it
's
true
that
if
thi
same
film
had
been
written
by
a
heterosexu
,
it
mai
have
been
more
controversi
,
but
becaus
it
wa
written
by
an
openli
gai
writer
,
the
prerog
wa
set
.

kevin
kline
,
who
onli
seem
to
becom
more
and
more
acclaim
,
star
as
howard
brackett
,
a
high
school
english
teacher
in
the
small
,
picturesqu
town
of
greenleaf
,
indiana
.

after
a
three-year
engag
to
fellow

emili
montgomeri
-lrb-
joan
cusack
-rrb-
,
a
wed
date
ha
been
set
,
and
the
hubbub
surround
it
is
almost
as
big
as
that

cameron
drake
-lrb-
matt

the

eagerli
await

event
,
and
both
seem
quit
astronom
,
but
littl
doe
anyon
know
how
much

.

when
cameron

is

the
winner
,
the
excit
is
heighten
as
he
pai
tribut
to
hi
high
school
english

everyon
is

he
's
gai

''

the
town
becom
silent
as
the
entir
popul
join
in
a
simultan
jaw
drop
.

the
thing
is
,
nobodi
,
includ
howard
,
can
understand
how
cameron
came
to
that
conclus
,
and
such
wild
and
unexpect
new
can
onli
wreak
havoc
in
such
a
conserv
american
haven
such
as
greenleaf
.

natur
the

-lrb-
bob
newhart
-rrb-
,
and
the
evid
start
to
becom
more
and
more
obviou
:
howard
is
clean
,
neat
,
honest
,
sincer
,
a
romant
,
and
perhap
the
most
incrimin
fact
,
he
love
barbara
streisand
.

the
frenzi
is
n't
help
ani
when
camera

who
unlik
the
collag

,
want
to
spend
a
whole
week
in
the
life
of
howard
brackett
,
includ
coverag
of

the
intrus
is
all
but
welcom
by
howard
,
who
is
go
more
and
more
out
of
hi
mind
with
each
pass
minut
.

it
seem
that
no
matter
where
he
turn
,
a
camera
is
be
shove
in
hi
face
and
question
regard
homosexu

be

the
domino
begin
to
tumbl
as
howard

friend
begin
act
differ
and
princip
halliwel
hint
at
a
possibl
termin
of

should
howard
inde
be

it
all
sound
veri
devast

and
it
would
be
if
it
were
n't
present
with
near-perfect

most
delight
ensembl
cast
.

kline
seem
onli
to
improv
with
ag
,
and
he
is
downright
perfect
here
.

the
great
thing
about
thi

is
that
