to

,
nicola
cage
sound
like
an
ideal
choic
for
the
lead
role
in
a
martin
scorses
film
.

despit
the
rant
that
sean
penn
so
rude
express
,
the
actor
remain
a
gift
and
versatil
screen
presenc
.

ever
sinc
the
big
success
of
the
action-thriller
`
face/off
'
in
1997
,
the
hollywood
road
ha
been
a
rocki
on
for
mr.
cage

the

`

but
who
better
than
scorses
to
match
cage
's
wit
and
intens
,
which
he
doe
in
miracul
fashion
with
`
bring

he

frank
is
accompani
by
a
fresh

everi

in

the

is

the

a

and
final

tom

is

i
found
it
uniqu
how
scorses
us
each
of
these
charact
for
a
singl
shift
with
frank
,
but
thei
never
figur
into
the
actual
plot
.

each
is
mere
a
color
presenc
to
help
develop
frank
's
charact
,
becaus
`
bring
out
the
dead
'
is
predominantli
a
studi
of
hi
mind
and
detail
person
.

the
on
charact
alongsid
frank
that
truli
come
into

is
mari

patricia
arquett
-rrb-
,
the
daughter
of
a
newli
admit
patient
who
suffer
from
a
sever
heart

arquett
,
who
recent
receiv
the
wound
of
christ
in
`
stigmata
'
,
perform
well
around
real-life
husband
cage
.

it
's
unfortun
that
,
after
such
intrigu
charact
trial
and
tribul
,
the
relationship
between
frank
and
mari
slip
dure
a

final

the
movi
belong
to
the
on-two
punch
of
cage
and
scorses
,
who
were
born
to
collabor
their
effort
in
an
arrang
similar
to
`

although
it

doe
`
bring

rival
scorses
's

work
?

onli

some
of

feel
surprisingli
limp

but
there
is

materi

those

mai
be
somewhat
dishearten
at
the
fairli
straight-arrow
approach-but
it
's
still
a
solid
,
admir
effort
.

`
bring
out

'
wa
written
by
the
acclaim
paul
schrader
,
who
collabor
with
scorses
on
such
classic
as
`
taxi
driver
'
and
`
rage
bull
'
.

schrader
's
script
is
full
of
moment-wonder

sharpli

ar

it
's
the

watch

as
he

,
and
you
'll
understand
why
he

.

`
bring

'
is
raw
and
electrifi
often
enough
to
mask
it

.

scorses-and
