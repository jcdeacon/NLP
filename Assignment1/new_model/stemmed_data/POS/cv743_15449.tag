onc
again
,
the
battl
is
dreamwork
versu
disnei
:
earlier
thi
year
,
the
mammoth
compani
fought
to
the
death
with
their
end-of-the-world
asteroid
flick
,
deep
impact
and
armageddon
.

here
we
ar
now
,
just
a
few
month
later
,
and
thei
're
at
it
again
with
duel
bug
movi
,
antz
and
a
bug
's
life
.

what
i
find
so
astonish
is
that
both
pair
of
movi
ar
so
inher
similar
in
both
stori
and
execut
.

i
mean
,
come
on
--
what
were
the
chanc
of
two
studio
both
decid
to
bring
out
comput-anim
film
about
bug
?

as
wa
the
case
with
the
meteor
movi
,
disnei
ha
come
out
on
top
:
though
antz
is
a
likabl
movi
,
a
bug
's
life
is
far
superior
.

in
fact
,
thi
movi
made
me
realiz
what
wa
wrong
with
antz
:
i
becam
immers
in
the
world
of
a
bug
's
life
,
while
antz
just
made
me
scrutin
everyth
.

but
it
's
not
realli
fair
to
base
an
entir
review
on
a
comparison
.

a
bug
's
life
is
a
remark
film
in
it
own
right
,
and
deserv
to
be
seen
apart
from
ani
other
comput-anim
film
about
bug
.

in
fact
,
it
's
on
of
the
best
film
thi
year
:
it
's
smart
,
subtl
,
and
funni
,
but
it
's
also
perfect
famili
entertain
and
relentlessli
entertain
.

i
have
n't
had
such
a
good
time
at
the
movi
in
month
.

it
tell
the
stori
of
an
ant
name
flick
-lrb-
voic
by
dave
folei
-rrb-
;
he
's
a
nice
gui
,
but
he
's
also
a
troublemak
.

the
ant
spend
all
season
put
togeth
the
offer
,
a
big
pile
of
food
that
thei
provid
for
the
grasshopp
.

just
befor
the
grasshopp
come
,
flick
accident
knock
over
the
offer
,
and
ruin
everyth
for
the
entir
coloni
:
the
grasshopp
's
leader
,
hopper
-lrb-
kevin
spacei
-rrb-
,
is
enrag
,
and
tell
them
that
the
ant
need
twice
the
food
by
the
end
of
summer
,
or
thei
're
all
dead
.

flick
,
feel
respons
for
thi
,
set
off
to
look
for
help
--
he
realiz
that
the
onli
wai
to
be
rid
of
the
grasshopp
is
to
fight
them
.

he
head
to

where
he

flick
doe
n't
know
thei
're
actor
,
and
thei
do
n't
know
that
flick
need
them
to
kill
a
bunch
of
grasshopp
,
so
thei
return
to
the
coloni
with
flick
and
find
themselv
in
an
unusu
posit
.

the
most
obviou
element
of
a
bug
's
life
is
the
qualiti
of
anim
.

creat
by
pixar
,
the
same
peopl
who
brought
us
toi
stori
,
a
bug
's
life
ha
some
of
the
most
amaz
visual
i
've
ever
seen
.

the
bug
seem
to
inhabit
a
three-dimension
space
,
and
occasion
there
will
be
a
shot
that
is
indistinguish
from
live
action
.

thi
is
a
lush
,
color
world
,
full
of
life
and
imagin
:
the
wai
the
anim
insert
the
thing
all
of
us
see
in
our
daili
live
-lrb-
match
,
bottlecap
,
tin
can
,
etc.
-rrb-
and
make
them
activ
object
in
the
bug
'
world
is
innov
.

the
film
is
also
mercilessli
excit
,
particularli
in
a
superbl-stage
scene
involv
our
hero
'
escap
from
a
bird
-lrb-
a
littl
bird
never
seem
so
huge
and
threaten
-rrb-
.

but
the
maker
of
a
bug
's
life
know
where
the
import
li
:
stori
and
charact
.

flick
,
with
solid
voic
work
from
folei
,
is
a
great
gui
to
lead
the
stori
.

but
the
real
treat
come
with
the
circu
bug
;
thei
're
such
a
likabl
group
of
charact
--
the
standout
ar
the
stick
-lrb-
hyde-pierc
is
so
good
-rrb-
,
franci
the
ladybug
,
and
the
big
fat
caterpillar
.

all
of
these
bug
have
more
than
a
token
person
,
which
make
the
suspens
scene
work
becaus
we
care
about
the
bug
,
and
it
also
keep
the
tear-jerk
scene
from
seem
obligatori
.

in
my
review
of
antz
,
i
said
that
the
film
is
a
clever
cop-out
becaus
it
present
a
bunch
of
littl
human
react
to
an
ant-like
exist
.

in
concept
,
a
bug
's
life
is
basic
the
same
movi
,
except
that
i
wa
never
given
enough
time
to
find
thing
that
i
did
n't
like
about
it
.

with
such
strong
work
in
both
anim
and
script
,
a
bug
's
life
is
noth
but
a
joi
to
sit
through
.

it
realli
is
too
bad
that
it
had
to
come
out
so
close
to
that
other
bug
movi
,
but
a
bug
's
life
is
so
good
that
i
'm
sure
it
will
find
it
audienc
.

after
a
slew
of
endlessli
violent
and
cynic
movi
,
it
's
downright
refresh
to
sit
through
an
innoc
pictur
like
thi
and
laugh
without
feel
guilti
.
