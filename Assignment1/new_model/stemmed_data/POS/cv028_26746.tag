the
creator
of
the
first
film
-lrb-
dan

and
ed

in
the
background
.

the
open
scene
--
the
documentari
show
the
townspeopl
affect
by
the
first
film
--
is
a
more
promis
approach
,
becaus
instead
of
try
to
cover
similar
ground
,
it
goe
outsid
the
first
film
and
make
it
own
stand
.

but
soon
the
movi
get
confus
and
sidetrack
by
it
own
stori
,
that
is
never
resolv
and
end
with
a
veri
anticlimax
epilogu
.

in
a
wai
,
thi
is
a
typic
hollywood
sequel
.

more
monei
ha
been
spent
and
more
peopl
have
work
on
a
project
that
wa
doom
to
fail
.

the
horror
and
suspens
of
the
origin
simpli
could
not
be
repeat
.

of
cours
in
these
situat
,
quantiti
is
more
import
than
qualiti
and
profit
is
more
import
than
the
artist
valu
.

from
it
open
scene
when
the
camera
gracefulli
pane
over
the
bloodi-red
forest
,
with
carter
burwel
's
-lrb-
``
be
john
malkovich
''
and
``

''
-rrb-
music
score
in
the
background
,
you
realiz
that
with
the
except
of
it
titl
,
thi
film
ha
absolut
noth
to
do
with
``
the
blair
witch
project
''
.

``
blair
witch
.
.
''

wa
film
by
handheld
videocamera
and
nfeatur
act
that
wa
mostli
base
on
improvis
.

in
the
sequel
the
technic
aspect
of
the
film
is
close
to
perfect
,
creat
a
complet
differ
atmospher
.

with
it
grace
cinematographi
,
product
design
and
flashi
edit
,
the
film
ha
a
veri
polish
look
,
which
is
imposs
to
associ
with
the
first
instal
.

and
though
berling
direct
hi
film
with
an
energi
and
pace
that
make
the
adrenalin
rush
through
the
bodi
a
coupl
of
time
,
he
ha
obvious
misunderstood
the
natur
of
hi
predecessor
.

the
kei
is
simplic
.

``
blair
witch
project
''
had
a
stori
which
wa
incred
simpl
.

that
allow
the
audienc
to
fill
the
gap
with
our
own
imagin
.

the
film
wa
practic
an
empti
screen
,
on
which
we
project
our
most
frighten
nightmar
.

the
effect
wa
incred
power
,
last
and
entir
e
everyon
,
but
in
a
differ
wai
.

``
book
of
shadow
''
feel
incred
control
and
restrict
.

here
,
veri
littl
is
left
to
our
imagin
and
the
stori
is
so
complex
and
``
clever
''
that
the
screenwrit
ar
the
first
to
get
lost
in
it
.

there
is
is
no
book
of
shadow
and
no
conclus
that
we
can
be
satisfi
with
.

thi
is
simpli
a
less
artist
film
that
doe
n't
have
the
talent
and
origin
of
it
predecessor
.

it
resort
to
fanci
cinematographi
and
special
effect
to
creat
the
right
effect
and
doe
n't
alwai
succe
.

but
most
importantli
:
it
stand
on
it
own
ground
and
ha
almost
no
connect
with
the
first
movi
,
which
doe
n't
allow
it
to
destroi
the
origin
.

in
the
end
,
i
ca
n't
call
it
a
bad
effort
.

it
's
less
artist
,
not
so
scari
and
less
origin
,
but
certainli
not
bad
.

it
's
simpli
differ
.

in
fact
,
if
you
have
n't
seen
``
the
blair
witch
project
''
,
you
might
like
thi
film
for
what
it
is
--
a
cross
between
``
the
blair
witch
project
''
and
the
``
scream
''
-
film
.

the
onli
element
that
remain
constant
and
similar
between
the
two
film
is
the
solid
act
-lrb-
jeffrei
donovan
and
tristin
skyler
should
be
mention
-rrb-
and
incred
sens
of
surreal
.

but
it
's
a
common
knowledg
and
experi
that
,
with
a
few
except
,
everi
movi
sequel
is
wors
than
the
origin
and
some
ar
even
not
worth
make
.

to
me
the
stori
of
``
the
blair
witch
project
''
seem
complet
,
but
there
ar
obvious
no
limit
to
commerci
success
that
``
the
book
of
shadow
''
is
certainli
assur
.

and
it
's
alreadi
time
to
look
forward
to
``
blair
witch
3
''
.
