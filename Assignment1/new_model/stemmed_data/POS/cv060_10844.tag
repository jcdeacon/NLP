that
peopl
would
flock

just

eat
a
bowl
of

the
problem
is
,
her

is
someth
less

popular
,
and
less
than
appet
.

howev
,
goro
agre
to
help
tampopo
in
her
quest
,
and
in
the
process
thei
seek
the
wisdom
of

elderli
noodl
expert
,
enlist
the
aid
of
a

for
exampl
,
when
tampopo

will
secretli
sell

a
more
afford
sum
.

tampopo
meet
him
at
hi
store
late
at
night
,
and
he
lead

to
a
back
room
.

she
protest
,
think
that
perhap
thi
man
ha
ulterior
motiv
,
but
he
insist
.

just
when
she
is
about

,
he
show

a
small
gap
in

wall
adjoin

the
soup
for
the
next
dai
,
her
face
fill
with
a
joi
that
can
be
felt
by
the
audienc
.

thi
scene
,
while
comic
,
is
veri
effect
at
fill
the
viewer
with
a
sens
of
trepid
,
then
of
relief
and
discoveri
.

there

an
interest
scene
where
goro
introduc
tampopo
and
her
son
to
a
bunch
of
street
peopl
who
,
despit
their
econom
trap
,

all
gourmet
and
master
sommeli
.

we
even
watch
as
on
of
them
sneak
into
the
kitchen
of
a
restaur
and
expertli
prepar
a
french
omelet
.

the
scene
is
meant
to
bring
a
laugh
,
but
it
also
sai
that
no
matter
whether
peopl
ar
rich
or
poor
,
food
is
someth
which
everyon
ha
in
common
,
and
the
enjoy
of
food
is
an
experi
share
by
all
.

there
ar
also
a
number
of
unrel
vignett
appear
throughout
the
film
,
which
help
to
illustr
and
accentu
the
role
of
food
in
peopl
's
live
.

a
particularli
effect
on
involv
a
wife
and
mother
be
tend
to
in
her
home
by
a
doctor
.

surround
by
her
children
,
she
is
obvious
in
her
last
hour
of
life
.

her
husband
come
home
,
and
see
her
worsen
condit
,
demand
that
she
get
up
and
make
dinner
.

the
viewer
know
the
husband
's
intent
is
not
to
be
mean
;
he
is
desper
for
the
normalci
of
which
he
and
hi
famili
ha
obvious
been
depriv
,
and
the
wife
make
dinner
is
an
essenti
part
of
thi
.

in
a
near
miracl
,
the
wife
drag
herself
to
the
kitchen
and
prepar
a
quick
meal
,
then
bring
it
to
her
await
famili
.

as
the
famili
eat
,
she
look
on
them
and
smile
.

prepar
food
for
her
famili
is
a
joi
and
a
comfort
to
her
,
and
for
a
brief
moment
,
she
too
enjoi
the
normalci
.

then
she
fall
over
,
dead
.

for
a
moment
,
the
famili
is
stun
,
but
then
the
father
yell
at
the
children
,
``
keep
eat
!
''

thi
is
the
last
meal
your
mother
ever
made
!
''
''

cry
as
thei
do
so
,
the
famili
finish
the
meal
.

the
scene
is
comic
,
awkward
,
move
,
and
beauti
.

by
includ
the
vignett
,
itami
ran
the
risk
of
creat
a
disjoint
film
,
but
surprisingli
,
thei
do
not
interrupt
the
pace
of
the
main
storylin
.

instead
,
thei
even
help
contribut
to
the
idea
that
tampopo
's
goal
of
be
abl
to
serv
except
food
is
worthi
and
even
nobl
.

becaus
the
film
parodi
a
western
,
the
construct
of
the
plot
is
fairli
predict
,
but
is
still
enjoy
as
we
watch
the
familiar
wai
in
which
the
``
good
gui
''
come
togeth
for
the
final
showdown
.

in
thi
case
,
the
showdown
is
against
the
ramen
.

if
thei
eat
tampopo
's
ramen
,
soup
and
all
,
tampopo
know
she
ha
succeed
.

it
's
pretti
obviou
what
the
outcom
will
be
,
but
when
a
film
chang
your
whole
perspect
on
someth
you
consum
everi
dai
of
your
life
,
you
can
afford
to
cut
it
a
littl
slack
.
