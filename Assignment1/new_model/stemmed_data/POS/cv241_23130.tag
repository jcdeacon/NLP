there

everyon

interest
in
the
``
scream
''
seri
wa
dy
to
know
how
it
would
end
.

what
would
be
the
``
final
act
''
?

thi
is
the
end
of
an
era
for
them
,
a
movi
which
ha
kept
them
up
night
search
for
clue
on
the
internet
,
talk
and
toss
around
rumor
with
their
equal
enthus
buddi
,
and
,
for

under

,
those

of
bui

to

no
need
to
worri
;
``
scream
3
''
is
endlessli
invent
and
entertain
,
a
fine
epilogu
to
the
seri
that
made
kevin
williamson
a
household
name
,
reinvent
the
horror
genr
,
and
continu
in
the
self-referenti
,
post-modern
tradit
of
quentin
and
co.
.

so
,
how
doe
the
stori
go
?

as
oppos
to
what
some
fanat
internet
site
would
have
you
believ
,

to

,
but
rather
in

,
live
,
understand

alon
in

confin
of
fenc
and
vast
secur
system
.

she
work
at
home
as
a
crisi
center
affili
over
the
phone
.

but
that
not
where
the
movi
start
off
.

instead
,
in
a
tactic
that
remind
me
of
the
somewhat
similar
,
and
conceptu
horrifi
,
sequenc
in
``
ey

-lrb-

now

home
to
hi

in

when
the
killer
call
,
demand
the
locat
of
sidnei
home
,
and
,
when
he
doesnt
get
it
,
threaten
the
life
of
cotton
girlfriend
christin
,
and
cotton
cant
do
anyth
to
stop
him
.

the
rest
of
the
sequenc
is
particularli
clever
,
set
up
a
constant
throughout
the
pictur
:
the
killer
ha
a
high-tech
electron
voic-changer
that
top
that
of
the
first
two
.

not
onli
doe
he
sound

-rrb-
,
he

and
dewei

-rrb-
.

at
the
same
time
,
stab
3
,
the
third
film-within-a-film
base
around
the
charact
and
event
of
woodsboro
and
windsor
colleg
,
ha
taken
a
less
authent
approach
thi
time
around
in
return
to
woodsboro
;
wherea
the
account
of
the
first
two
film
wa
true
,
the
franchis
within
``
scream
''
ha
now
becom
total
fiction
.

nevertheless
,
we
learn
,
cotton
made
an
appear
in
the
movi
which
is
now
in
product
,
as
himself
to
be
kill
off
in
the
first
scene
.

so
,
it
seem
that
the
real
killer
is
of
our
hero
in
the
order
in
which
thei
bite
it
in
the
movi'either
the

or
the

a

and
no

still
,
all
the

onli
visit

for
the
first
half-hour
of
the

while
also
have

of

which
take
us
back
a

to
sidnei
fear
of
becom

,
at

,
what

i
often
find
myself
compel
to
pop
in

can
get

throughout

,
i
notic
a

more

than
the
other

grant
that

there
consider

some
critic
have
note
that
``
scream
3
''
seem
to
take
itself
more
serious
thi
time
;
mayb
so
,
or
mayb
screenwrit
ehren

-lrb-

-rrb-
,
who
took
over
after

saw
an
opportun
for
true
ironi
`
mayb
even
a
littl
bit
of
satir'if
the
film
work
in
a
few
more
clich
.

what
put
a
damper
on
thi
otherwis
except
and
creativ
film
,
im
afraid
,
is
the
end
,
or
,
rather
,
the
ident
of
the
killer
.

it
doe
the
job
,
i
guess
,
accomplish
what
it
should
,
bring
the
three
film
full
circl
,
but
upon
my
first
view
it
seem
rather
dissatisfi
becaus
it
appear
a
littl
too
contriv
,
too
arbitrari
;
after
a
second
view
,
which
i
endeavor
upon
due
to
thi
recur
disapprob
,
the
killer
ident
still
seem
a
littl
too
random
,
but
hi
motiv
came
across
more
sound
thi
time
around
,
and
the
eventu
conclus
wa
ultim
more
satisfi
.

all
in
all
,
``
scream
3
''
doe
not
fall
victim
to
the
most
lament
principl
of
a
trilogi
:
it
is
not
the
worst
of
the
film
.

as
a
trilogi
,
``
scream
''
wa
a
lot
of
fun
;
refresh
,
humor
,
offbeat
.

almost
sad
to
see
it
go
.

but
then
,
it
doe
seem
best
to
quit
while
your
ahead
,
and
``
scream
3
''
doe
a
fine
job
of
provid
closur
to
it
charact
.

for
now
,
``
scream

hold
the
titl
as
the
finest
seri
of
horror
film
to
be
commit
to
celluloid

not
