``
memento
''
is
the
sort
of
movi
i
wish
i
'd
written
;
i
can
think
of
no
higher
prais
than
that
.

i
am
enviou
that
nolan
ha
concoct
such
a
brilliant
,
involv
,
origin
movi
as
thi
.

an
instant
film
noir
classic
,
``
memento
''
is
virtual
flawless
.

the
script
is
unlik
ani
i
have
ever
seen
--
a
notabl
achiev
in
these
dai
of
recycl
hollywood
homogen
.

although
the
idea
of
start
at
the
``
conclus
''
of
the
plotlin
and
then
move
backward
in
time
to
the
``
start
''
is
not
entir
new
,
never
befor
have
i
wit
it
execut
with
such
flair
and
coher
.

``
memento
''
is
endlessli
excit
and
invent
,
a
rare
stori
which
keep
the
viewer
guess
dure
the
film
itself
,
and
mull
over
it
connot
long
after
leav
the
theatr
.

and
it
is
not
mere
an
exercis
in
cerebr
;
there
is
plenti
of
action
and
an
unexpect
dose
of
humour
to
keep
the
proceed
live
.

nolan
's
direct
is
equal
effect
,
never
lose
it
crisp
and
clariti
despit
``
memento
''
's
challeng
gimmick
.

and
to
top
everyth
off
,
all
the
perform
rise
to
the
occas
.

pierc
is
terrif
as
the
troubl
leonard
;
moss
show
great
rang
as
enigmat
natali
;
and
pantoliano
's
teddi
achiev
a
splendidli
affabl
yet
sinist
qualiti
.

``
memento
''
mai
be
the
year

and
is
certainli
amongst
the
top
