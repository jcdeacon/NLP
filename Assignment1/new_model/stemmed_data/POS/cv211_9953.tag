-rrb-
,
the
alien
seri
got
a
face-lift
of
immens
proport
.

instead
of
be
a
suspens/scienc
fiction
film
,
cameron
alter
the
seri
and
chang
it
into
an
action
pictur
.

what
result
is
on
of
the
most
terrifi
film
ever
creat
.

a
film
like
alien
come
along
onli
onc
in
a
while
,
and
when
it
doe
,
audienc
ar
usual
unprepar
for
it
.

i
never
saw
thi
movi
in
theater
,
but
i
wish
i
could
have
.

the
terror
and
fright
must
have
been
unimagin
,
most
like
with
audienc
member
liter
shriek
in
fear
.

alien
is
an
action
film
unlik
ani
i
have
ever
seen
.

with
a
scienc
fiction
plot
,
cameron
give
alien
ad
testosteron
,
pump
up
the
action
and
fire
power
from
the
origin
film
.

in
fact
,
alien
is
on
of
those
few
sequel
which
top
the
origin
.

perhap
what
make
the
alien
seri
so
impress
is
the
hero
--
or
heroin
,
as
the
case
mai
be
.

never
have
we
had
a
more
sympathet
hero
in
an
action
film
,
and
never
have
i
seen
such
an
impress
act
job
done
by
the
main
charact
.

sigournei
weaver
is
possibl
the
onli
actress
who
could
plai
thi
charact
and
make
her
realist
enough
for
us
to
care
about
.

place
a
woman
in
these
situat
would
sometim
seem
unusu
,
but
becaus
of
weaver
's
presenc
,
a
woman
is
the
onli
suitabl
hero
.

alien
beginsyear
after

howev
,
when
the
compani
lose

,
riplei

alien
not
onli
multipli
the
thrill
and
suspens
from
scott
's
version
,
it
also
multipli
the
number
of
alien

.

alien
focus
on
on
alien

which
systemat
kill
each

,
except

who
manag
to
jettison

alien
focus
on
an
entir

of
these
alien
,
and
as
a
result
,
the
chill

incred
heighten
.

then
again
,
thi
is
jame
cameron
,
the
gui
who
ha
given
us
true
li
and
termin

:
judgment

he
is
the
best
action
director
out
there
-lrb-
top
renni
harlin
,
who
direct
cliffhang
-rrb-
,
and
onli
he
could
creat
someth
as
terrifi
as
thi
film
.

it
seem
that
everi
alien
film
seem
to
have
some
memor
scene
or
scene
,
and
alien
ha
the
motherload
.

with
perhap
on
of
the
most
astonish
end
ever
creat
for
an
action
film
,
alien
climax
never
seem
to
hit
until
the

is
nearli

i
ca

ever
to
sustain
thi
level
of

never

just
when
you

is
over
,
someth
els
will
occur
,
and
it
start
right
back
up
again
.

with
a
seemingli
endless
conclus
,
alien
end
with
on
of
the
greatest
moment
in
film
histori
.

thi
scene
is
usual
the
on
rememb
most
from

of
cours
,
for
a
film
of
thi
genr
to
work
properli
,
the
technic
aspect
must
be
realist
enough
for
us
to
believ
what
we
see
.

alien
is
complet

,
even
a

after
it
initi
releas
.

the
special

ar
wonderfulli
seamless
,
with
a
terrifi
alien
to
go
with
them
.

on
of
the
most
overlook
aspect
of
thi
film
is
the
music
,
compos
by
cameron-regular
jame

.

horner

,
the

music
is
also
some
of
the
most
recogn
of

.

the

is
incred
