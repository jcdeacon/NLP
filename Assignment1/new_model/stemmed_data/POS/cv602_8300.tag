everyon
's
heard
about
thi
movi
,
and
more
specif
,
*
the
*
scene
.

everyon
's
heard
the
famou
barnyard
anim
quot
squeal
-lrb-
no
pun
intend
-rrb-
over
and
over
.

and
everyon
's
got
to
admit
that
thei
will
never
travel
down
a
river
again
without
think
of
deliver
.

good
!

that
's
what
you
're
suppos
to
do
!

oh
,
if
you
ar
on
of
the
on
who
ha
n't
seen
thi
yet
,
or
you
-lrb-
somehow
-rrb-
have
n't
heard
about
what
happen
,
here
's
your
spoiler
warn
.

deliver
wa
a
real
shocker
for
it
's
time
-lrb-
1972
-rrb-
.

major
advanc
were
be
made
in
film
,
and
deliver
made
it
own
advanc
when
it
introduc
a
new
horror
into
the
film
industri
.

when
it
wa
first
releas
,
it
liter
shock
the
audienc
.

it
wa
someth
that
,
for
the
most
part
,
had
realli
never
been
seen
on
the
big
screen
befor
-lrb-
among
wide-releas
film
with
an
r
rate
-rrb-
.

but
by
todai
's
film
standard
and
in
todai
's
world
,
such
scene
as
the
on
in
deliver
can
be
reproduc
in
a
wai
that
is
n't
as
shock
,
although
thei
can
be
even
more
graphic
-lrb-
e.g.
pulp
fiction
-rrb-
.

pulp
fiction
did
it
in
a
wai
,
and
expand
on
it
in
a
wai
,
that
it
could
even
be
interpret
as
funni
.

but
in
1972
,
deliver
wa
no
laugh
matter
.

the
stori
center
around
a
group
of
four
atlanta
men
who
decid
to
take
a
raft
trip
down
a
backwood
river
in
georgia
while
the
river
is
still
there
and
in

glori
.

the
initi
leader
of
the
group
is

the
group
's
first
object
is
to
find
someon

drive
their
car
down
the
river
to
the
point
where
thei
will
end
their
trip
.

thei

a
few
mountain
men
,
who
accept
$
40.00
for
the
task

the
famou
``

the
men
then
set
off
down

river
,
with
lewi

also
the
master
at

the
other
hillbilli
get
awai
,
and
the
men
have
to
decid
what
to
do
with
the
dead
bodi

dispos
of
dead

is
done
rather
frequent
throughout
thi
film

deliver
is
definit
a

it

definit
