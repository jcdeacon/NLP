vampir
lore
and
legend
ha
alwai
been
a
popular
fantasi
element
,
substanti
by
not
onli
the
sheer
number
of
movi
about
the
subject
,
but
also
the
prolifer
of
cult
and
sect
of
adher
.

and
,
unlik
ani
of
the
more
outlandish
myth
,
the
vampir
hold
some
real-world
probabl
-lrb-
on

-rrb-
.

but
lest
the
nasti
be
mistaken
for
simpl
comic
book
bad
gui
,
john
carpent
would
like
to
remind
us
that
thei
ar-and
alwai
have
been-a
truli
frighten
element
of
the
thriller
genr
.

and
remind
us
he
doe
in
hi
latest
film
,
vampir
.

there
wa
some
question
,
as
halloween
weekend
approach
,
of
how
well
vampir
would
do
in
comparison
to
new
line
cinema
's
immens
success
blade
,
releas
in
august
.

the
two
film
take
notic
differ
stand
on
the
vampir
issu
,
and
do
n't
even
agre
on
some
basic
point
of
the
slai
method
.

-lrb-
for
instanc
,
blade
's
main
weapon
ar
silver
and
garlic
,
wherea
main
charact
jack
crow
's
techniqu
is
a
wooden
stake
to
the
heart
.
-rrb-

blade
also
give
more
of
a
face
to
the
vampir
civil
,
while
carpent
would
like
us
to
remain
in
the
dark
about
how
the
pasti
oper
.

both
have
their
advantag
,
and
here
,
carpent
's
style
lend
itself
to
a
darker
breed
of
suspens
rather
than
the
action
movi
that
blade
director
stephen
norrington
deliev
.

when
it
's
all
said
and
done
,
though
,
the
vampir
still
kill
and
die
with
a
bloodi
flourish
;
the
level
for
gore
is
inde
set
to
maximum
.

thi
time
,
our
hero
is
vatican-sponsor
slayer
jack
crow
-lrb-
jame
wood
-rrb-
.

he
's
a
cynic
,
battl-worn
veteran
,
and
the
best
of
hi
bunch
.

he
and
hi
team
ar
respons
for
clean
out
the
american
southwest
,
and
after
extermin
a
nest
on
night
,
thei
run
up
against
a
super-vampir
-lrb-
term
a
``
master
''
-rrb-
name
valek
-lrb-
thoma
ian
griffith
-rrb-
.

valek
kill
all
of
jack
's
team
except
for
hi
partner
,
toni
montoya
-lrb-
daniel
baldwin
-rrb-
,
and
as
the
two
regroup
,
thei
learn
that
valek
is
the
origin
vampir-now
over
six
hundr
year
old
.

appar
,
valek
and
hi
minion
have
been
sweep
the
southwest
for
decad
in
search
of
a
cross
that
will
enabl
them
to
walk
in
the
daytim
.

so
with
the
aid
of
a
priest
name
adam
-lrb-
tim
guine
-rrb-
and
a
bitten
hooker
-lrb-
sheryl
lee
-rrb-
as
bait
,
thei
track
valek
down
for
the
final
confront
.

the
script
for
vampir
,
written
by
don
jakobi
and
base
on
the
john
steaklei
novel
,
is
perhap
the
wittiest
piec
of
screenplai
to
see
product
all
year
.

crow
,
in
particular
,
is
a
fun
sourc
of
on-liner
,
and
wood
doe
everi
on
of
them
with
perfect
stoicism
.

baldwin
,
lee
,
and
guine
ar
all
fine
support
,
ad
to
the
charact
pool
,
but
the
other
true
highlight
of
the
movi
is
thoma
ian
griffith
's
bad
gui
.

griffith
's
intens
express
is
perfect
for
the
role
,
and
the
onli
downsid
is
that
he
's
got
to
talk
sometim
.

luckili
,
he
's
got
few
line
,
and
manag
to
pull
off
a
rather
thrill
perform
.

all
said
,
fan
will
sure
be
impress
by
thi
pictur
,
and
those
who
found
apt
pupil
a
bit
limp
will
be
excit
by
thi
on
.

certainli
a
worthwhil
visit
to
the
theater
