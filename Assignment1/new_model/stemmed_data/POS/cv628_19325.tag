summer
blockbust
movi
meant
mostli
for
children
but
with
enough
wit
and
charm
for
adult
to
be
interest
and
at
least
entertain
by
the
stori
.

the
basic
premis
is
the
same
as
everi
other
`
tarzan
'
stori
:
a
boi
is
rais
in
the
african
jungl
by
gorilla
and
becom
on
himself
never
realli
understand
-lrb-
or
even
notic
-rrb-
that
he
's
human
and
is
a
lot
differ
from
the
anim
he
befriend
.

the
first
third
of
the
film
show
how
tarzan
come

,
is
a
mean

conserv
leader
of
the
pack
of

as
a
son
and
often
ha
to
hold
himself
back
from
kill
tarzan
after
he
continu
doe
danger
,
wild
thing
that
ar
the
result
of
hi
own
childish
instinct
.

i
have
a
feel
children
will
quickli
be
abl
to
identifi
with
tarzan
sinc
all
he
realli
is
is
just
a
kid
who
want
to
have
fun
and
it
's
funni
how
the
adult
fail
to
comprehend
thi
.

later
,
as
the
stori
transit
from
tarzan
as
a
child
to
a
full-grown
man
-lrb-
voic
by
goldwyn

,
he
is
encount
by
a
parti
of
three
human

england

jane
porter

a
beauti

also
a
scientist
;
and
their
slick
and
cun
,
yet
barbar
safari
bodyguard
clayton
-lrb-
bless
-rrb-
.

it
's
easi
to
tell
where
the
stori
is
go
at
all
time
but
the
screenplai
doe
n't
seem
like
it
wa
written
hastili
nor
dumb
down
for
children
's
enjoy
.

sure
there
's
a
lot
of
clich
stuff
here
,
like
clayton
's
smug
and
diabol
manipul
of
tarzan

-rrb-
.

there
's
also
a
lot
of
fun
action
such
as
tarzan
's
swing
through
the
jungl
on
vine
and
slide
down
and
around
tree
branch
and
trunk
.

it
's
just
