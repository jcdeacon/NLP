also
like

it

in

as
is
the
case
with
most
chan
film
,
the
plot
itself
is
just
about
irrelev
.

the
sole
purpos
of
mr.

chan

and
those

none

-lrb-
the
final
,
as

it
is
,
is
a
letdown
for
fan
of

,
mr.

hint
at
jacki
chan
's
latest
transit
to
hollywood
product
-lrb-
he
made
ill-fate
attempt
with
1980
's
the
big
brawl
and
1985
's
the
protector
-rrb-
;
next
in
the
pipelin
is
rush

,
a

co-star
chri

hopefulli
that
film
will
be
a
mere
divers
in
tinseltown
,
and
chan
will
continu
with
exuber
hong

product
such
as
mr.

ar
sure
to
be
dilut
