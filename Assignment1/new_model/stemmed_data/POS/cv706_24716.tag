``
shanghai
noon
''
is
just
good
fun
.

the
chemistri
between
the
cast
is
remark
.

the
perform
ar
all
accept
within
the
whimsic
level
of
the
film
.

jacki
's
perform
is
as
good
as
anyth
he
's
done
befor
.

he
's
not
call
on
to
do
much
act
here
,
as
the
charact
is
not
written
with
ani
depth
.

but
jacki
's
natur
charisma
shine
through
,
and
hi
comic
time
is
so
perfect
,
both
physic
and
-lrb-
surpris
-rrb-
verbal
that
onc
again
he
command
the
screen
whenev
he

the
embarrass
remak
of
``
the
haunt
''
,
give
a
good
natur
perform
as
roi
o'bannon
.

hi
innoc
is
refresh
and
fun
.

a
bad
gui
that
's
not
realli
bad
.

hi
scene
with
jacki
ar
some
of
the
best
bit
of
comic
duel
sinc
martin
and
lewi
.

luci
liu
as
princess
pei
pei
is
given
littl
to
do
in
the
script
,
but
for
a
chang
doe
not
plai
a
nymphet
or
some
other
deviant
.

the
charact
is
a
nobl
woman
of
statu
and
wealth
,
but
find
a
greater
caus
as
a
result
of
her
own
imprison
.

the
rest
of
the
perform
ar
all
broadli
drawn
comic
perform
.

noth
here
is
realist
,
mind
you
.

``
shanghai
noon
''
is
first
and
foremost
a
light
,
jovial
film
.

and
the
perform
match
that
style
with
eas
.

the
cinematographi
by
dan
mindel
is
gorgeou
.

us
calgari
,
alberta
as
the
prime
locat
.

mr.
mindel
is
abl
to
creat
a
lush
,
romant
western
feel
to
the
film
.

noth
here
realli
look
like
nevada
,
but
the
locat
ar
so
beautifulli
shot
and
stage
,
the
film
can
be
look
upon
as
a
love
tribut
to
earlier
film
of
the
genr
.

and
as
such
,
the
script
by
alfr
gough
and
mile
millar
plai
fast
and
loos
with
histori
,
but
with
rever
to
past
film
.

homag
to
such
film
as
``
high
noon
''
-lrb-
obvious
-rrb-
,
``
red
river
''
and
most
notabl
``
butch
cassidi
&
the
sundanc
kid
''
all
bring
a
sens
of
nostalgia
to
the
film
.

it
is
a
comfort
experi
.

at
a
time
when
the
western
is
consid
either
old
hat
or
irrelev
,
here
is
a
film
that
embrac
those
old
attitud
and
-lrb-
dare
i
sai
-rrb-
clichés
and
manag
to
make
them
palat
and
refresh
.

here
is
a
film
that
is
not
contemptu
of
the
genr
.

thi
is
the
purest
``
hors
opera
''
sinc
the
dai
of
georg
o'brian
or
john
wayn
.

director
tom
dei
ha
craft
a
love
tribut
to
hollywood
's
past
.

in
thi
,
hi
first
film
mr.
dei
show
both
a
love
of
charact
and
of
craftsmanship
that
is
refresh
to
see
.

noth
here
realli
stand
out
,
or
take
on
's
attent
awai
from
the
stori
or
action
.

and
that
is
as
it
should
be
,
when
jacki
chan
is
your
star
.

and
what
of
the
action
and
stunt
.

well
,
while
not
up
to
a
level
of
``
drunken
master
2
''
or
ani
of
jacki
's
hong
kong
film
,
``
shanghai
noon
''
is
mile
ahead
of
anyth
jacki
ha
done
in
an
american
film
befor
.

hi
time
,
choreographi
,
and
creativ
ar
still
as
sharp
as
ever
.

jacki
even
get
to
recreat
a
few
scene
from
hi
earlier
film
-lrb-
obviou
to
those
of
us
that
have
seen
those
film
,
but
refreshingli
fun
for
those
unfamiliar
-rrb-
.

final
jacki
can
honestli
sai
,
that
he
ha
made
an
u.s.
,
hi
wai
and
incorpor
hi
style
.

to
sum
up
,
``
shanghai
noon
''
is
a
fun
summer
confect
.

not
too
heavi
and
not
too
light
.

a
fun
and
entertain
film
that
the
whole
famili
can
enjoi
