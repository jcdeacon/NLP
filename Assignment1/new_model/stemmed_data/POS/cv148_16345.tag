warren
beatti
return
to
the
screen
in
the
funniest
,
craziest
and
hard
hit
movi
in
hi
career
.

base
on
a
stori
concoct
by
himself
,
and
also
written
by
beatti
,
bulworth
give
a
good
insight
of
what
beatti
think
of
the
american
govern
system
.

beatti
star
as
senat
jai
bulworth
,
who
's
go
through
a
nervou
breakdown
.

after
hire
someon
to
kill
him
,
he
complet
chang
hi
campaign
strategi
and
tell
the
honest
truth
about
what
's
_
realli
_
happen
in
american
polit
,
much
to
the
annoy
of
assist
denni
murphi
-lrb-
platt
.
-rrb-

instead
of
everyon
hate
him
,
the
american
public
love
him
.

howev
,
insid
hi
parti
,
more
peopl
want
to
kill
him
than
just
the
hire
assassin
.

and
he
also
strike
a
relationship
with
black
girl
nina
-lrb-
berri
.
-rrb-

it
's
remark
that
thi
film
wa
releas
at
all
.

much
more
open
than
the
rather
subdu
primari
colour
,
bulworth
bare
give
the
american
polit
system
a
good
name
.

the
outrag
remark
bulworth
make
to
hi
potenti
voter
ar
veri
funni
,
and
also
somewhat
true
.

it
's
great
that
beatti
is
n't
afraid
to
let
loos
on
a
subject
.

talk
of
beatti
,
he
's
excel
in
the
role
of
the
dement
senat
,
clear
have
fun
.

and
see
warren
beatti
have
fun
is
a
rare
sight
inde
.

even
in
dick
traci
,
he
wa
the
most
straighten
face
actor
.

-lrb-
then
again
,
he
wa
the
onli
charact
face
we
could
complet
see
.
-rrb-

the
film
give
an
opportun
for
the
61
year
old
beatti
to
indulg
in
some
rap
,
which
he
doe
with
gusto
-lrb-
and
also
quit
well
.
-rrb-

and
see
beatti
as
a
'
homeboi
'
ha
to
be
seen
to
be
believ
.

it
's
nice
to
see
that
beatti
can
laugh
at
himself
.

second
best
is
oliv
platt
as
the
fluster
,
coke
snort
assist
,
who
goe
over
the
top
when
he
final
snap
.

hall
berri
is
fine
,
and
sexi
,
as
the
intellectu
nina
,
who
come
to
like
the
senat
.

also
pop
up
in
the
support
cast
is
paul
sorvino
wit
h
a
strang
accent
,
lauri
metcalf
as
the
exact
same
charact
she
's
also
plai
,
and
christin
baranski
of
cybil
fame
as
bullworth
wife
,
who
all
contribut
to
the
fun
.

and
,
thi
be
a
polit
film
,
the
ubiquit
larri
king
make
an
appear
,
as
,
*
shock
*
,
himself
.

the
write
and
direct
,
both
by
beatti
,
ar
abov
par
.

the
direct
is
veri
nearli
sitcom
like
,
but
suit
the
film
perfectli
,
and
both
the
polit
ar
gangland
part
ar
handl
well
.

the
script
is
funni
,
and
the
rap
ar
actual
well
produc
and
humor
,
and
quit
clever
.

thei
're
not
cring
induc
,
at
least
.

the
script
make
mani
point
about
societi
in
america
todai
,
and
is
n't
afraid
to
make
ani
bold
statement
about
what
is
a
flaw
system
.

best
of
all
,
the
film
is
thought
provok
,
but
direct
and
written
in
such
a
wai
that
the
film
feel
as
light
as
a
feather
,
and
is
veri
entertain
.

there
's
also
a
great
rap
soundtrack
with
some
well
chosen
tune
.

bulworth
is
a
film
with
mani
advantag
,
and
few
flaw
.

perhap
it
could
be
somewhat
embarrass
to
see
a
61
year
old
man
rap
,
but
beatti
doe
it
so
well
it
's
irrelev
.

in
fact
,
there
's
veri
littl
against
bulworth
,
except
for
the
languag
which
is
veri
heavi
,
but
then
again
it
should
be
expect
.

bulworth
,
then
,
is
well
worth
watch
.
