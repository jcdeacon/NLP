jon
pertwe
-rrb-
to
drive
rumpo
out
of
town
.

instead
,
the
rumpo
kid
shoot
the
sheriff
dead
.

therefor
,
judg

send
for
a
law

to
come
in
and
clean
up

is
assign

without

,
as
the
law

for
stodg

he
arriv
at
the
same
time
as

oaklei
-lrb-
angela
dougla
-rrb-
who
is
seek
reveng
for
her

,
the

when

he
soon
becom
awar
of
the
misunderstand
and
due
to
hi
rather
limit
intellect
,
he
is
manipul
by
the
rumpo
kid
and
alwai
end
up
get
thing
wrong
.

in
the
end
,
there
is
a
head-to-head
between
rumpo
and
marshal
.

with
the
rumpo
's
past
experi
,
it
would
seem
that
marshal
is
out
of
hi
depth
,
but
us
hi
sanitari
skill
and
learn
the
wai
of
the
west
from
anni
oaklei
,
he
at
least
stand
some
chanc
!

sid
jame
,
with
an
american
accent
,
is
perfect
as
the
rumpo
kid
,
a
part
which
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
.

jim
dale
provid
on
of
hi
best
carri
on
perform
as
the
stupid
sanitari
engin
,
and
angela
dougla
is
veri
effect
in
her

other
regular

hawtrei
and
bernard
bresslaw
-lrb-
in
hi
debut
-rrb-
as
big

and
littl

.

big

is
the
local
indian
leader
and
the
crazi
cast
of
hawtrei
for
thi
part
is

kenneth

us
a

.

even
so
,
thi
carri
on

a
veri
differ
carri
on

,
in
that
it
is
plai
more
serious
by
the
actor
and
possess
more
realism
than
ani
other

the

is
the
highest

a

not
