as
jerri
and

fall
in
love

can
he
do
what
must
be
done
to
fulfil
hi
pledg
?

at

,
``
the
pledg
''
appear
to
be
just
anoth
standard
,
if
well-execut
,
crime
drama
.

it
is
anyth

in

final
hour
,
it
turn
the
corner
and
becom
a
rivet
,
terrifi
studi
of

hi

is
jerri
,
a

so
haunt
by
hi
pledg
that
it
consum
the

at

draw
horrifyingli
into

nicholson
is
fantast

;
jerri
's
gradual
descent
into
obsess
is
like
a

,
a
thing
horribl

each

it
all
build
up
to
a

which
linger
