until
i
saw
the
night
of
the
hunter
,
it
had
been
a
long
time
sinc
i
had
gasp
while
watch
a
movi
.

forget
the
other
and
the
deep
end
-lrb-
which
veer
toward
strain
dramat
-rrb-
,
the
night
of
the
hunter
is
by
far
the
scariest
movi
i
've
seen
so
far
thi
year
.

even
though
the
movi
is
nearli
50
year
old
and
there
's
a
not
drop
of
blood
to
be
seen
.

luckili
,
the
night
of
the
hunter
,
charl
laughton
's
first
and
final
direct
gig
,
ha
been
restor
by
the
ucla
film
and
televis
archiv
and
is
be
re-releas
in
octob
2001
.

so
,
there
's
still
plenti
of
time
to
spill
your
popcorn
all
over
the
place
.

robert
mitchum
star
as
harri
powel
,
a
reverend
with
a
nasti
habit
of

salli
jane
bruce
-rrb-
,
who
know
where
the
monei
is
,
but
ar

the
hard
part
about
see
a
classic
now
is
the
pop
cultur
monster

usual
drawn
and
quarter
and
then
flaunt
all
the

-rrb-

ye
,
there
ar
some
visual
element
that
other
director
seem
to
have
borrow
from
the
night
of
the
hunter
.

powel

,
i
wa
amaz
