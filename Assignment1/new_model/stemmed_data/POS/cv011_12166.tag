somewher
along

there

that
shatter

even

we
saw

onli

to
the
disappoint

but
for
over
an
hour
,
citi
of
angel
is
well
worth
the
time
.

nicola
cage
is
seth
,
a
guardian
angel
who
,
like

like

spend

who
begin
to
ponder
exactli
who
it

we
're
fight

after

these

envelop

and
seth

the
angel
who
wa

never

can
not

but
thei
do
have
the
abil
to
make

he
doe

,
quit
regularli
,
although
such
a
thing
seem
taboo
among
the
angel

the

ar
interestingli
present
,
all
of
them
dress
in
black
and
more
reminisc
of
hitmen
than
tradit
glow

but
it
's
a
nice
touch
that
never
seem

versatil
actor

think

and
it
could
happen
to
you-what
a
combo
!
-rrb-

who
slip
into
the
role
of
a
heavenli
agent
quit
nice
but
threaten
sappi
more
than
onc
.

it
's
nice
to
see
ryan
pick
up
role
like
thi
and
the
on
in
courag
under
fire
.

the
two
ar
n't
veri
compar
to
each
other
,
but
thei
both
deviat
from
her
usual
``
intellig
ditzi
''
romant
comedi
role
,
and
it
's
an
impress
side
of
ryan
movi
goer
rare
have
the
chanc
to
enjoi
.

but
even
though
the
two
lead
do
an
impress
job
,
it
is
denni
franz
who
grab
us
with
hi
interpret
of
a
hospit
patient
who
know
more
than
meet
the
ey
.

it
's
a
shame
that
with
so
much
go
for
it
,
citi
of
angel
falter
so
much
in
it
final
stage
,
leav
us
with
the
realiz
that
an
emotion
incred
movi
wa
out
there
,
thei
just
did
n't
know
quit
how
to
get

it
.

thei
struggl

an
impact
conclus
and
wind
up
with
pain
thud
rather
than
an
exhilar

.

filmmak
should
know
your
final
impress
will
be
the
on
you
linger
on
,
rememb
,
and
convei
to
other
thru
word
of
mouth
,
so
after
tell
us
for
60
+
minut
that
thi
film
is
a
gloriou
masterpiec
,
thei
sure
leav
us
with
a
dishearten
tast
of
mediocr
in
our
mouth
.

base
on
the
german
film
wing
of
desir
-lrb-
that
be
the
english
titl
,
of
cours
-rrb-
,
citi
of
angel
is
nineti
percent
success
,
enough
to
make
most
peopl
forgiv
it
shortcom
,
even
the
devastatingli
disappoint
end
.

most
movi
goer
,
the
non-cynic
anywai
,
will
be
too
wrap
up
in
the
surreal
atmospher
to
give
critic
to
that
which
need
to
be
critic
.

nonetheless
,
citi
of
angel
is
beautifulli
captiv
,
which
is
probabl
enough
to
satisfi
those
poetic
viewer
who
will
appreci
