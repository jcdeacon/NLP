jennif
love
hewitt
and
brandi
turn
in
respect
perform
.

brandi
in
particular
wa
impress
,
consid
thi
is
her
first
featur
film
.

you
could
see
that
the
charact
were
horrifi
,
and
thei
would
do
anyth
possibl
to
surviv
.

matthew
settl
and
freddi
prinz
jr.
ar
a
complet
differ
stori
.

let
's
start
with
settl
.

matthew
is
complet
fake
in
thi
film
.

you
could
not
believ
a
word
come
out
of
hi
mouth
.

you
could
tell
he
wa
act
,
and
it
reason
like
him
that
thi
on
is
n't
as
good
as
the
first
on
.

he
doe
do
a
good
job
toward
the
end
,
but
that
doe
n't
clear
up
the
scar
he
alreadi
left
on
the
film
.

freddi
prinz
jr.
is
almost
as
bad
as
matthew
settl
wa
.

he
is
almost
complet
unbeliev
,
and
the
major
of
hi
line
ar
complet
meaningless
and
out
of
place
.

we
do
n't
see
him
as
much
as
settl
,
otherwis
he
could
have
done
just
as
much
damag
as
settl
did
.

mekhi
phifer
is
alright
as
tyrel
,
but
yet
again
the
dialogu
is
out
of
place
.

the
plot
of
i
still
know
turn
out
to
be
a
pretti
good
on
at
the
end
of
the
movi
.

i
like
where
the
filmmak
went
with
thi
second
instal
,
but
mayb
if
it
occur
in
the
same
town
as
the
first
on
,
it
would
have
been
a
bit
better
.

the
cinematographi
and
set
of
their
island
ar
simpli
wonder
.

there
ar
a
lot
of
veri
nice
shot
around
their
hotel
.

the
sound
is
pretti
good
,
but
still
not
as
creepi
as
the
first
film
's
.

jennif
love
hewitt
's
song
,
``
how
do
i
deal
''
is
also
plai
for
about
thirti
second
.

i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
is
noth
compar
to
the
first
film
.

the
first
film
wa
veri
suspens
,
and
it
contain
some
veri
memor
scene
.

the
last
fifteen
minut
of
i
still
know
what
you
did
last
summer
realli
pick
up
,
and
almost
reach
the
same
level
as
the
first
film
.

befor
thi
part
in
the
film
,
there
ar
mani
unnecessari
death
and
fake
scare
.

that
is
okai
though
,
becaus
the
film
is
still
veri
much
fun
and
there
ar
a
few
suspens
scene
.

i
think
the
reason
thi
film
wa
n't
as
scari
as
the
origin
wa
becaus
in
the
first
on
,
the
killer
terror
the
peopl
involv
in
the
incid
.

he
made
them
suffer
for
what
thei
did
.

in
the
second
film
,
ben
willi
just
kill
anyon
he
feel
like
.

he
doe
n't
stick
with
rai
and
juli
,
who
were
the
on
he
is
actual
after
.

he
had
to
go
after
karla
,
will
,
and
tyrel
.

if
the
charact
he
stalk
were
in
some
relat
to
the
incid
that
went
on
when
he
wa
ran
over
by
juli
,
rai
,
helen
,
and
barri
,
it
could
have
been
much
better
,
and
it
would
have
made
a
lot
more
sens
.

the
bottom
line-not
a
disappoint
,
but
a
third
in
the
seri
would
be
out
of
hand
.
