all
done

although
never
brilliant
,
analyz
thi
is
also
never
rubbish
,
which
make
for
a
fun

littl
close
to
hi

he

robert

is
hilari
as

,
plai
it
dead
straight
but
come
off
as
realli
funni
.

he
's
a
seriou

unawar
that
he
is
a

her

from

,
which
is
get
rather
tiresom
,
and
doe
n't
come
off
well
on
the
screen
.

the

the
film
genuin
plai
like
a
proper
gangster
movi
,
but
with
laugh
instead
of
hard
ass
talk
.

it
sometim
get
a
littl
bloodi
for
a
light
heart
film
,
but
it
strang
fit
in
.

spoof
ar
made
of
famou
gangster
movi
,
includ
a
nice
parodi
of
the
godfath
.

the
italian
tune
plai
throughout
the
soundtrack
contribut
to
the
fun
.

there
's
also
some
odd
plot
point
:
fbi
gui
appear
and
suddenli
disappear
for
no
appar
reason
.

it
is
true
that
analyz
thi
ha
had
a
somewhat
chequer
product
histori
,
and
perhap
the
plot
point
were
expand
in
a
earlier
version
of
the
script
.

unfortun
,
thi
is
hollywood
,
so
we
will
never
know
.

harold
rami
,
best
known
as
egon
from
ghostbust
,
ha
a
deft
touch
with
direct
comedi
,
as
shown
in
the
immort
groundhog
dai
,
and
the
less
immort
caddyshack
.

all
the
comic
potenti
in
a
scene
is
dug
out
and
present
to
the
audienc
.

the
script
,
written
by
rami
along
with
peter
tolan
and
ken
lonergan
,
start
off
funni
,
remain
funni
for
the
most
of
the
film
,
but
sadli
peter
out
somewhat
dure
the
last
twenti
minut
where
it
wrongli
enter
more
seriou
territori
.

the
film
is
short
,
howev
,
and
just
befor
audienc
interest
is
wane
the
film
suddenli
goe
into
a
rather
rush
and
unsatisfi
end
and
the
credit
roll
.

analyz
thi
is
a
good
comedi
,
and
is
certainli
worth
watch
.

robert
de
niro
sob
is
reason
enough
to
watch
it
,
even
though
it
doe
seem
forc
,
or
like
a
parodi
-lrb-
although
i
think
thi
wa
intent
.
-rrb-

crystal
is
hi
most
likeabl
in
year
,
kudrow
is
given
as
littl
screen
time
as
possibl
,
which
is
a
good
thing
,
and
de
niro
is
just
awesom
.

it
's
no
goodfella
,
and
it
probabl
wo
n't
be
rememb
as
much
as
groundhog
dai
,
but
analyz
thi
is
a
well
done
comedi
that
wo
n't
leav
you
feel
cheat
.
