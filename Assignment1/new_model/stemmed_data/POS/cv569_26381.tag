a
rather
disappoint
``
mari
railli
''
,
stephen
frear
is
now
offici
back
in
busi
with
a
comeback
worthi
of
prais
.

thi
is
on
of
the
best
surpris
of
thi
season
--
a
sweet
,
small
budget
comedi
with
a
big
heart
.

in
fact
it
's
not
even
a
comedi
.

it
's
a
drama
or
even
more
precis
--
a
clever
satir
on
human
relationship
and
need
.

base
on
a
1995
critic
acclaim
novel
by
british
author
nick
hornbi
,
``
high
fidel
''
is
a
wry
and
likabl
stori
about
a
man
's
quest
for
fulfil
and
happi
.

rob
gordon
wa
a
dj
.

it
seem
that
he
could
make
everyth
spin
--
except
hi
own
life
.

now
he
own
championship
vinyl
,
a
littl
music
store
,
somewher
in
new
york
.

when
he
suddenli
get
dump
by
hi
girlfriend
,
a
gorgeou
blond
attornei
,
life
suddenli
loos
everi
purpos
.

decim
,
humili
and
on
the
verg
of
a
mental
-lrb-
and
emot
-rrb-
breakdown
,
he
start
medit
over
hi
life
and
the
wai
it
could
have
been
--
about
what
's
right
and
what
's
import
.

he
start
``
categor
''
life
,
divid
it
into
``
toplist
''
.

and
the
most
import
is
the
``
toplist
''
over
the
most
pain
breakup
of
hi
life
,
start
with
5th
grade
,
when
he
found
hi
young
girlfriend
with
anoth
boi
.

though
you
might
think
that
peopl
chang
,
grow
more
matur
with
ag
,
it
just
doe
n't
seem
that
wai
and
all
rob
's
relationship
were
differ
version
of
that
first
.

where
did
he
go
wrong
?

wa
it
he
that
screw
up
?

or
mayb
life
just
stink
?

while
he
is
lost
in
hi
own
self-piti
,
he
must
think
of
the
``
toplist
''
over
hi
need
for
the
futur
,
find
the
right
element
and
mix
hi
life
togeth
.

with
clever
parallel
to
the
cult
of
celebr
,
music
and
with
incred
direct
narrat
,
it
address
the
averag
audienc
member
,
in
other
word
--
peopl
like
you
and
me
.

although
a
lot
of
thi
honor
should
be
address
to
the
screenwrit
______
and
frear
,
the
director
,
the
act
is
equal
import
as
the
written
word
.

and
here
john
cusack
should
absolut
be
mention
.

he
is
simpli
superb
.

it
is
as
much
hi
movi
as
it
is
frear
'
.

the
film
would
not
be
the
same
without
him
.

cusack
--
whose
charact
is
sadder
,
wiser
and
--
bring
intellig
and
warmth
to
post-mod
ironi
.

most
of
hi
dialogu
is
deliv
directli
to
the
camera
--
not
an
easi
task
--
but
cusack
pull
it
off
.

hi
interpret
feel
so
emotion
right
,
so
incred
realist
and
precis
that
frear
'
messag
simpli
ca
n't
be
ignor
or
overseen
.

the
other
member
of
the
cast
do
an
equal
remark
job
.

both
______
and
jack
black
ar
fabul
.

even
catherin
zeta
jone
appear
in
a
role
where
she
actual
act
,
not
just
look
beauti
.

howev
,
the
most
unexpect
pleasant
surpris
is
provid
by
todd
louiso
who
deliv
a
spectacular
comic
perform
as
rob
's
co-worker
and
friend
dick
.

thi
is
such
an
impress
achiev
that
it
's
almost
worth
a
oscar-nomin
.

he
is
simpli
a
joi
to
behold
.

otherwis
,
everyon
ar
in
their
place
,
and
at
the
right
time
--
all
part
of
frear
'
color
blend
.

pretti
much
like
edward
norton
's
``
keep
the
faith
''
,
thi
film
doe
n't
follow
ani
formula
or
belong
to
ani
genr
--
it
's
dramat
,
tragic
,
sarcast
,
comic
and
even
cynic
,
but
never
bitter
or
angri
.

it
's
a
littl
bit
of
everyth
,
pretti
much
like
life
itself
.

noth
seem
unreal
or
stage
.

it
reflect
realiti
as
a
mirror
.

as
you
watch
it
,
you
go
through
the
same
emot
problem
as
the
main
charact
.

you
feel
and
think
and
reflect
.

thi
effect
ha
becom
a
rariti
nowadai
.

although
it
's
primarili
about
the
peril
of
love
,
``
high
fidel
''
is
secondarili
about
pop
music
.

rob
own
championship
vinyl
and
hi
employe
,
timid
dick
-lrb-
todd
louiso
-rrb-
and
overbear
barri
-lrb-
jack
black
-rrb-
,
ar
fellow
music
snob
.

music
is
the
languag
in
their
live
,
the
measur
by
which
thei
defin
themselv
and
mark
the
signific
event
of
their
live
.

and
so
doe
the
movi
.

it
is
as
much
a
music
film
as
anyth
els
,
as
rob
's
journei
is
wonderfulli
portrai
through
carefulli
insert
music
fragment
.

in
the
end
,
you
have
gain
someth
while
watch
it
.

it
's
not
the
film
of
the
centuri
or
even
of
the
year
.

it
's
not
an
special
effect
extravaganza
.

it
doe
n't
requir
big
explos
or
digit
creatur
to
succe
.

it
's
a
small
movi
about
the
big
thing
.

and
even
though
it
doe
not
contain
heavi
philosophi
,
you
feel
as
if
you
have
experienc
someth
of
signific
,
and
you
will
experi
that
nice
warm
feel
for
quit
some
time
.
