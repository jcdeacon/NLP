.

also
,
the
trailer
is

,
which
wa
an
interest
choic
.

when
clue
plai
in
theater
,
it
ran
with
the
gimmick
of
three
differ
end
.

if
you
want
to
see
all
three
,
you
had
to
go
to
the
movi
three
separ
time
.

so
when
the
film
wa
releas
on
home
video
,
rather
than
releas
three
separ
video
,
all
three
end
were
includ
on
on
tape
...
the
first
two
end
be
``
what
if
?
''

end
and
the
third
end
be
the
actual
end
.

now
for
the
dvd
releas
you
get
two
choic
.

you
can
watch
the
film
as
it
wa
present
on
home
video
or
you
can
select
to
watch
it
with
on
of
the
three
end
randomli
chosen
for
you
.

-lrb-
note
:
there
's
an
easter
egg
hidden
in
the
disc
pertain
to
thi
.

after
watch
the
film
with
a
randomli
select
end
,
when
you
return
to
the
menu
screen
you
will
be
abl
to
highlight
the
larg
magnifi
glass
and
select
it
.

when
you
do
,
a
secret
menu
open
,
allow
you
to
watch
ani
of
the
three
end
by
themselv
.
-rrb-

now
while
i
applaud
the
effort
of
paramount
here
,
as
thei
clearli
tri
to
do
someth
special
with
the
disc
,
it
just
doe
n't
work
well
.

first
,
why
not
give
the
viewer
the
choic
of
what
end
we
want
to
watch
?

mayb
someon
like
myself
who
's
seen
the
movi
hundr
of
time
would
like
to
sit
down
and
show
it
to
someon
with
the
second
end
onli
.

i
'm
no
technic
dvd
expert
,
but
i
ca
n't
imagin
that
be
too
hard
to
accomplish
.

secondli
,
the
delai
between
when
the
film
itself
end
and
on
of
the
end
begin
is
too
long
and
too
obviou
,
therebi
becom
a
distract
right
when
you
definit
do
n't
need
a
distract
.

final
,
the
back
of
the
dvd
case
state
``
and
now
,
with
thi
special
dvd
version
,
you
can
see
all
3
surpris
end
''
.

i
have
no
idea
why
thei
would
word
it
that
wai
,
sinc
that
's
not
a
special
featur
in
the
slightest
.

the
video
ha
been
out
for
fifteen
year
now
-lrb-
good
lord
,
ha
it
been
that
long
?
-rrb-

and
it
's
plai
on
televis
with
all
three
end
all
the
time
.

these
ar
mere
minor
complaint
howev
,
see
that
i
've
watch
the
home
video
version
hundr
of
time
and
have
no
problem
watch
the
film
as
such
on
the
dvd
.

the
pictur
and
sound
ar
wonderfulli
improv
over
my
worn
out
vh
copi
,
and
i
'm
thrill
that
paramount
agre
with
me
that
clue
is
a
film
worthi
of
be
preserv
on
thi
great
digit
format
.
