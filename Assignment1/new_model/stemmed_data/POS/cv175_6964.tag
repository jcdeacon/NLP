of

thi

no

you
ar

that
probabl
reflect
more
on
how
pallid

-lrb-
i
suspect
the

sweetback

hassl
by
two
white
cop
who
ar
appar
just
look
for
an
excus
to
beat
up
on
a
black
man
,
break
hi
bond
and
run
like
hell
.

along
the
wai
he
move
through
a
good
mani
of
the
kind
of
environ
that
we
ar
onli
just
now
be
seen
in
a
more
seriou
light
in
the
movi
--
or
at
all
,
for
that
matter
:
the
slum
,
the
mission
,
the
ghetto
.

in
other
,
lesser
,
movi
,
sweetback
would
be
machin-gun
everyth
in
sight
and
the
end
credit
would
roll
over
a
pile
of
bodi
;
in
thi
on
,
we
get
taken
on
a
kind
of
a
tour
of
the
depress
and
anarch
world
that
sweetback
take
for
grant
.

ssba
first
appear
in
1971
and
wa
promptli
rate
x
-lrb-
``
by
an
all-white
juri
''
,
as
director
melvin
van
peebl
crow
in
hi
legendari
ad
campaign
-rrb-
,
and
it
's
hardli
surpris
why
.

there
's
a
good
deal
of
sex
in
the
movi
,
but
it
's
handl
in
a
wai
that
's
unsettlingli
frank
--
a
frank
that
spill
over
into
the
rest
of
the
movi
.

in
on
scene
,
sweetback
visit
a
friend
's
hous
in
the
hope
of
get
sanctuari
there
,
and
the
other
man
chat
him
up
while
on
the
toilet
.

we
're
not
us
to
come
thi
close
to
peopl
in
real
life
,
let
alon
in
the
movi
--
especi
not
peopl
who
ar
not
made
out
to
be
glamor
.

the
movi
is
also
full
of
experiment
stylist
that
ar
rel
unus
todai
,
but
probabl
becaus
of
that
seem
curious
fresh
and
new
in
van
peebl
'
hand
.

on
scene
,
in
which
a
man
is
interrog
by
the
cop
,
is
load
full
of
menac
energi
as
thei
fire
off
a
gun
inch
from
hi
ear
,
and
suggest
hi
deaf
through
a
cleverli
edit
soundtrack
.

anoth
note
:
ssba
is
not
so
much
anti-white
-lrb-
that
would
be
too
easi
-rrb-
as
anti-author
,
and
as
the
movi
goe
on
to
demonstr
,
author
exist
in
mani
form
--
govern
,
church
,
and
even
the
paranoid
insid
of
on
's
own
mind
.

ssba
is
ultim
about
thirst
for
freedom
--
and
it
look
like
we
could
us
a
littl
more
of
that
in
our
movi
diet
,
god
know
.
