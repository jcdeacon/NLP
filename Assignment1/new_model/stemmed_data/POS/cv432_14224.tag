``

not

thi

becaus
it
is
an
extrem
deviat
from

origin
comic

-rrb-
why
is
thi
?

for
the
most
part
,
it
is
becaus
the
filmmak
understand
the
comic
book
medium
and
come
up
with
an
appropri
atmospher
to
match
.

the
crow
and
batman
comic
call
for
a
dark
gothic
atmospher
,
which
the
director
provid
.

the
mask
featur
a
wacki
superhero
with
off
the
wall
antic
,
which
the
cast
and
cg
effect
reflect
.

superman
is
not
over
the
top
with
colour
and
flash
,
and
the
film
reflect
thi
.

blade
us
common
notion
of
vampir
and
incorpor
them
into
the
film
,
creat
an
appropri
atmospher
.

thi
is
in
stark
contrast
to
joel
schumach
's
contriv
vision
in
batman
and
robin
,
reflect
the
date
atmospher
in
the
1960
's
televis
show
.

batman
and
robin
prove
that
the
director
fail
to
realiz
on
fundament
fact
:
comic
have
grown
up

and
so
ha

which
bring
me
back
to

although
he
mai
be
a
familiar
charact

,
due
to
hi
appear
in

on
will
find
no
