there
ar
time
when
the
success
of
a
particular
film
depend
entir
on
on
actor
's
effort
.

often
a
singl
perform
can
turn
what
might
have
been
a
rather
mediocr
movi
into
someth
worthwhil
.

when
on
of
these
come
along
,
i
usual
try
to
think
about
how
mani
other
peopl
put
work
into
the
movi
,
that
there
is
no
wai
on
person
could
possibl
carri
the
entir
project
on
hi
shoulder
.

but
sometim
there
is
simpli
no
other
explan
,
and
such
is
the
case
with
``
the
hurrican
.
''

thi
biopic
about
fals
convict
boxer
rubin
``
hurrican
''
carter
would
normal
be
call
``
norman

,
'
''
as
per
the
tradit
of
refer
to
a
film
``
belong
''
to
a
director
.

but
though
he
doe
decent
work
,
jewison
can
not
claim
ownership
of
``
the
hurrican
,
''
becaus
there
is
on
reason
thi
film
work
at
all
,
and
hi
name
is
denzel

maintain
that
he
had
never

but
remain
in

after
a

and

the
situat
chang
when
a
group
of
canadian
move
to
washington
and
work
on

through
the
effort
of
that

freed
when
their

which

flash

when

live
with

ey
to
the
injustic
that

-rrb-
to
work
with
him
toward
hi
goal

``
the
hurrican
''
lean
on
denzel
washington
.

he
must
carri
virtual
everi
scene
by
sheer
forc
of
will
,
and
he
doe
so
brilliantli
.

it
's
probabl
accur
to
sai
that
washington
doe
not
embodi
rubin
carter
,
becaus
he
plai
a
charact
far
stronger
and
nobler
than
ani
real
person
could
hope
to
be
.

it
would
perhap
be
more
accur
to
sai
that
washington
embodi
the
charact
of
rubin
carter
--
a
fiction
person
invent
sole
for
the
film
.

the
actor
's
work
is
master
;
washington
throw
himself
into
everi
moment
,
refus
to
keep
the
audienc
at
arm
's
length
.

we
feel
everyth
he
feel
:
the
humili
of
have
to
return
to
prison
after
fight
so
hard
to
make
someth
of
hi
life
,
the
pain
of
have
to
order
hi
wife
to
give
up
the
fight
,
and
the
utter
despair
he
feel
when
come
to
the
conclus
that
all
hope
is
lost
.

washington
's
is
a
perform
of
weight
and
emot
depth
.

he
doe
n't
mere
plai
angri
,
happi
,
or
sad
;
he
feel
it
at
the
deepest
level
.

hi
work
is
master
,
and
for
half
of
thi
film
i
realiz
that
the
scene
i
wa
watch
would
not
have
been
nearli
as
affect
as
it
wa
if
it
had
been
in
the
hand
of
anoth
actor
.

norman
jewison
direct
the
film
,
do
a
reason
good
job
of
pace
and
shot
select
.

``
the
hurrican
''
move
quickli
,
with
no
scene
drawn
out
much
further
than
necessari
and
the
narr
gallop
along
nice
.

jewison
handl
hi
multipl
flashback
well
;
the
audienc
is
alwai
awar
of
just
what
the
time
and
place
of
each
scene
is
,
and
noth
is
terribl
confus
.

hi
box
scene
,
construct
with
clear
inspir
from
``
rage
bull
,
''
get
insid
the
action
veri
well
,
and
thei
ar
believ
as
real
sport
footag
.

jewison
put
togeth
a
particularli
nice
scene
by
util
a
pretti
cool
trick
:
carter
is
sent
to
solitari
confin
fordai
when
he
refus
to
wear
a
prison
uniform
,
and
jewison
,
assist
by
some
wonder
act
from
a
game
washington
,
show
how
carter
gradual
start
to
lose
hi
mind
dure
the
constant
solitud
,
and
eventu
we
get
three
rubin
carter
argu
with
each
other
in
on
cell
.

jewison
's
best
achiev
in
``
the
hurrican
''
is
succeed
at
show
how
carter
becom
an
embitt
man
dure
hi
hard-knock
life
,
and
how
he
is
abl
to
break
out
of
that
bitter
and
learn
to
trust
peopl
again
.

sadli
,
though
,
the
film
's
chief
failur
lie
with
the
screenplai
,
as
with
most
of
the
good-but-not-great
effort
to
round
the
pike
thi
winter
.

there
is
much
to
interest
a
viewer
in
``
the
hurrican
,
''
but
it
seem
that
everi
time
the
film
get
a
chanc
to
take
the
most
clich√©d
rout
possibl
,
it
doe
.

take
a
look
at
the
support
charact
,
for
exampl
,
who
ar
drawn
up
as
either
entir
good
or
entir
evil
.

carter
and
lesra
-lrb-
plai
nice
by
shannon

who
deserv
credit
-rrb-
ar
the
onli
real
peopl
here
;
everyon
els
is
a
stereotyp

the

ar
good

the

ar
bad
.

the
canadian
spend
most
of
their
time
dolefulli
grin
at
each
other
in
their
lovei-dovei
commun
-lrb-
and
it
is
a
commun
,
despit
the
film
's
failur
to
make
that
clear
-rrb-
,
while
everi
racist
cop
-lrb-
especi
dan

-rrb-
melt
in
out
of
the
shadow
and
glower
at
everi
black

much
of

``
hate

''

love

''
-rrb-

,
and
the
big

which
everyon

to
make
an
impass
speech
could
have
been
lift
from
a
made-for-tv
lifetim
special
.
''

it
's
too
bad
.

the
cast
is
game
,
the
director
doe
hi
job
,
and
the
subject
matter
is
interest
,
but
the
script
take
the
safer
,
slightli
more
bore
rout
far
too
often
.

i
want
a
real
reason
for
the
cop
to
hold
a
grudg
against
carter
other
than
``
he
's
a
racist
pig
.
''

i
want
more
evid
that
these
canadian
ar
real
peopl
with
fault
and
virtu
instead
of
a
bunch
of
saintli
crusad
look
for

.

in
short
,
i
want
to
see
the
film
through
a
less
distort
len

critic
ha
been
levi
against
the
liberti
``
the

''
take
with
the
truth
of
what
realli
happen
to

and
much
of
it
is
deserv

for
exampl
,
the

most
account
of

have

furthermor
,
much
of
carter
's
crimin
past
is
conveni
left
out
of
the
film
,
and
just
why
he
wa
convict
again
in
hi
second
trial
is
never
realli
explain

of
cours
,
``

work

even
