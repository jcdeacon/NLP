is
not

much
a

that
monstrou
outrag
against
human
as
a
backdrop
to
tell
a
stori
of
famili
love
,
devot
and

the
movi
start
out
as
a
typic
slapstick
farc
with
benigni
's
guido
arriv
in
the
small
tuscan
town
of
arezzo
in
1938

,
a
local
school
teacher
who
alreadi
is
engag

offici
.

in
benigni
's
tightli
wound
script
thi
is
the
same
fascist
offici
with
whom
guido
had
an
earlier
unfortun-yet
slapstick-encount
.

fast
forward
about
five

for

scene
in

lack
the
horror
,
the
pain
,
the
unimagin
suffer
of
a
schindler

true
,
mani

but
to

.

unlik
steven
spielberg
,
benigni
is
not
out
to
tell
the
stori
of
the
holocaust
.

hi
stori
is
about
famili
and
the
length
a
parent
will
go
to
protect
a
child
.

for
guido
,
to
save
hi
son
,
transform
the
entir
experi
into
an
elabor
game
.

giosu
´
must
follow
the
rule
without
question
to
amass
1,000
point
.

the
winner
take
home
a
tank
.

therefor
,
guido
tell
him
,
he
must
remain
hidden
in
the
barrack
.

he
can
not
make
a
sound
nor
allow
the
guard
to
see
him
.

guido
explain
thi
dure
a
hilari
sequenc
when
a
german
guard

guido

the

with
wonder
and
delight
,
think
he
ha
won
the
game
.

the
price
for
hi
victori
is
most
high
.

benigni
ha
succeed
in
us
the
blackest
moment
in
human
histori
to
prove
that
even
in
hell
,
a
rai
of

salvat
can
penetr
the
dark
.

life

beauti
is
a
fantasi

a
fabl
.

it
is
not

as
a
record
of
the

.

those
who
object
to
it
ar
miss
it
point
.

and
that
is
simpli
where
there
is
hope
,
where
there
is
life
and
where
there
is
love
,
the
spark
of
