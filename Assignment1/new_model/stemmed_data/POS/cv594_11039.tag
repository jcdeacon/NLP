hate
letter
pour
in
on
thi
on
,
folk
.

.

much
as

the
same
sentenc
...
hell
,
same
paragraph
as
the
wed
singer
,
i
'm
bound
to
be
lynch
.

well
lynch
me
then
,
becaus
i
thought
adam
sandler
and
drew
barrymor
had
the
most
convinc
chemistri
in
recent
memori
,
with
titan
as
the
onli
except
.

right
awai
,
you
're
readi
to
discount
my
review
,
ar
n't
you
?

you
're
think
that
i
ca
n't
possibl
know
what
i
'm
talk
about
.

after
all
,
thi
is
adam
sandler
right
???
well
,
there
's
more
...
i
actual
got
choke
up
,
and
more
than
onc
.

ye
,
the
man
who
brought
us
billi
madison
and
happi
gilmor
wa
abl
to
bring
sincer
tear
to
my
ey
.

but
befor
you
shrug
me
off
as
an
imbecil
,
i
urg
you
to
see
the
movi
and
see
for
yourself
.

the
wed
singer
is
the
stori
of
robbi
hart
-lrb-
sandler
-rrb-
,
a
1985
rock
star
wannab
whose
soul
achiev
in
life
ha
been
perform
cover
tune
at
wed
recept
for
the
past
five
year
or
so
.

but
when
hi
own
wed
result
in
a
no-show
for
the
bride
-lrb-
angela
featherston
as
linda
-rrb-
,
robbi
begin
to
re-examin
hi
life
,
and
wonder
why
true
love
doe
n't
exist
for
peopl
like
him
.

in
the
process
of
perform
at
these
recept
,
robbi
meet
a
waitress
name
julia
,
plai
with
wholesom
sweet
by
drew
barrymor
,
whose
reput
is
anyth
but
thi
charact
.

julia
too
is
engag
,
and
when
robbi
find
himself
without
a
wife
,
hi
free
time
allow
him
to
help
her
plan
her
own
wed
,
see
as
how
her
fianc
,
the
``
miami
vice
''
love
glenn
-lrb-
matthew
glave
-rrb-
,
doe
n't
seem
all
that
interest
.

as
the
time
goe
by
,
we
learn
the
reason
glenn
is
do
dispassion
about
the
wed-he
's
mere
marri
julia
to
prevent
a
breakup
,
someth
he
want
to
avoid
even
if
he
doe
sleep
around
with
ton
of
other
women
.

it
's
obviou
that
robbi
is
go
to
fall
for
julia
and
feel
a
strong
need
to
rescu
her
,
but
what
is
a
lightheart
romant
comedi
for
?

thi
is
n't
sleepless
in
seattl
,
but
i
'd
actual
compar
it
to
that
befor
i
'd
compar
it
to
happi
gilmor
.

while
the
wed
singer
maintain
some
of
that
post-snl
cornbal
humor
,
it
sincer
and
charm
carri
it
a
veri
,
veri
long
wai
.

sandler
is
great
in
hi
role
,
and
ye
,
if
you
allow
it
,
you
can
take
him
serious
.

barrymor
seem
perfect
along
side
him
,
and
although
the
two
more
like
repres
gen-x
moron
and
parti-girl
ditzism
-lrb-
respect
-rrb-
,
the
two
go
togeth
like
bread
and
butter
as
a
mid-eighti
coupl
.

on
scene
in
particular
,
where
julia
ponder
the
futur
in
a
mirror
,
is
so
well
done
,
i
wa
on
the
verg
of
tear
.

unfortun
,
sandler
is
go
to
make
a
lot
of
peopl
shrug
thi
on
off
as
a
no-brainer
,
but
it
's
got
so
much
surpris
substanc
pack
insid
that
i
'm
encourag
everyon
to
go
see
it
.

in
fact
,
the
entir
theater
applaud
when
the
film
end
,
and
laugh
were
so
consist
,
some
joke
were
probabl
miss
due
to
the
uproar
.

the
1985
set
wa
milk
for
everyth
it
wa
worth
,
and
for
those
of
us
that
ar
old
enough
to
rememb
it
,
it
wa
a
bodaci
trip
back
-lrb-
and
done
veri
well
-rrb-
.

sandler
show
a
new
side
to
himself
while
maintain
all
hi
origin
charm
-lrb-
or
is
it
anti-charm
?
-rrb-
.

while
the
wed
singer
onli
deserv
three
star
due
to
artist
merit
,
grade
it
on
pure
enjoy
would
give
thi
on
four
star
.

it
's
hilari
,
and
it
's
touch
.

it
's
got
that
great
cheezi
humor
,
but
it
also
take
sandler
to
a
higher
level
than
anyon
expect
.

thi
is
on
to
see
again
and
again
.

is
it
possibl
the
wed
singer
could
be
on
of
the
sweetest
romant
comedi
of
1998
?

my
``
magic
8-ball
''
predict
it
is
certain
.
