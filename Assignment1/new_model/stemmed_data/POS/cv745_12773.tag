as
much
as
anyth
,
the
film
is
a
seri
of
charact
sketch
.

in
on
of
the
strongest
we
watch
william
in
a
flashback
as
he
ha
hi

a

with

finess
the

the
joi
of

all
of

he
still
prefer
male

the
film
is
at
it
most
poignant
in
sever
sequenc
in
which
the
grown
william
come
face-to-face
with
himself
when
younger
.

thi
caus
hi
ugli
old

in

wa
so
overwhelm
with
the

even
here
,
the
director
touch
your
heart
without
ever
let
the
stori
dissolv
into
anyth
approach
a
tearjerk
.

the
ultim
result
is
an
uplift

that
ha
more
hope
that

ever
expect
from
