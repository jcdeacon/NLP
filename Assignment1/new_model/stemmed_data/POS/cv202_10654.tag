steven
spielberg
's
``
amistad
,
''
which
is
base
on
the
true
stori
of
a
group
of
african
who
revolt
on
board
a
slave
ship
,
then
were
captur
and
taken
to
america
where
a
legal
disput
ensu
over
who
``
own
''
them
,
is
concern
with
sever
differ
aspect
of
thi
stori
.

first
,
the
film
address
the
issu
of
the
inher
evil
of
slaveri
.

second
,
it
deal
with
the
histor
involv
of
sever
american
politician
in
the
case
,
includ
presid
martin
van
buren
and
former
presid
john
quinci
adam
-lrb-
anthoni
hopkin
-rrb-
.

last
,
and
most
importantli
,
it
examin
the
cultur
confus
experienc
by
the
african
who
were
forc
into
slaveri
and
the
damag
done
to
their
nativ
cultur
in
africa
by
the
slave
trade
.

``
amistad
''
succe
at
least
partli
with
all
three
of
these
element
.

i
have
to
admit
that
i
wa
a
littl
skeptic
as
to
how
much
i
could
realli
get
out
of
anoth
``
anti-slaveri
''
movi
.

have
seen
sever
other
movi
and
documentari
about
slaveri
,
i
doubt
that
there
wa
much
i
did
n't
alreadi
know
about
it
.

fortun
,
i
turn
out
to
be
wrong
.

for
on
thing
,
spielberg
's
camera
never
onc
get
near
a
southern
plantat
and
instead
stick
to
the
slave
ship
and
the
slave
trader
'
oper
in
africa
,
so
``
amistad
''
wa
deal
with
a
differ
part
of
the
histori
of
slaveri
from
the
veri
begin
.

and
some
of
the
imag
here
ar
,
in
fact
,
much
more
harrow
than
what
we
usual
see
in
movi
about
slaveri
.

on
scene
in
the
middl
,
in
which
the
crew
of
a
slave
ship
dispos
of
some
of
their
``
excess
''
slave
by
throw
them
overboard
to
drown
,
ha
to
be
on
of
the
most
disturb
film
imag
of
the
year
.

spielberg
dig
farther
into
the
evil
of
slaveri
than
i
wa
expect
he
would
,
and
in
fact
he
probabl
goe
about
as
far
as
a
movi
director
can
without
get
an
nc-17
rate
.

the
stark
suffer
of
the
african
is
contrast
sharpli
with
the
shallow
luxuri
of
the
politician
,
such
as
presid
van
buren
and
queen
isabella
of
spain
,
whose
naval
offic
were
involv
in
the
legal
disput
and
who
wa
onli
a
small
child
at
the
time
.

expos
politician
as
narrow-mind
,
opportunist
hypocrit
is
fairli
standard
stuff
,
of
cours
,
but
spielberg
and
writer
david
franzoni
do
it
well
enough
that
it
still
come
off
as
someth
more
than
just
a
simpl
exercis
in
audienc
manipul
.

the
film
also
examin
the
contenti
natur
of
the
slaveri
issu
at
the
time
,
such
that
john
quinci
adam
-lrb-
and
probabl
other
politician
like
him
-rrb-
,
who
clearli
disapprov
of
the
practic
,
wa
reluct
to
get
involv
in
the
case
until
it
wa
appeal
all
the
wai
to
the
suprem
court
.

the
biggest
success
of
``
amistad
''
is
probabl
the
character
of
cinqu
-lrb-
djimon
hounsou
-rrb-
,
who
emerg
as
the
de
facto
leader
of
the
kidnap
african
and
struggl
to
commun
with
baldwin
-lrb-
matthew
mcconaughei
-rrb-
,
the
lawyer
who
repres
them
in
court
.

through
cinqu
,
we
ar
given
a
window
into
the
nativ
cultur
,
as
he
and
the
displac
african
try
to
explain
to
the
prison
guard
what
thei
need
for
a
proper
burial
of
a
dead
tribe
member
,
or
find
an
illustr
version
of
the
bibl
and
try
to
understand
the
stori
of
jesu
christ
.

cinqu
see
the
disput
with
a
clariti
and
simplic
that
,
again
,
contrast
with
the
technic
and
mechan
of
the
legal
process
and
of
the
polit
squabbl
.

``
what
kind
of
countri
is
thi
,
where
law
'
almost
'
work
?
''

he
ask
baldwin
in
bewilder
,
when
he
learn
that
the
case
must
be
re-tri
befor
the
suprem
court
.

spielberg
's
direct
tend
a
littl
bit
toward
the
manipul
side
at
time
,
such
as
when
he
add
a
heavi
orchestr
swell
to
cinqu
's
angri
outburst
in
the
court
room
.

still
,
there
is
n't
enough
of
thi
for
it
to
be
a
seriou
problem
.

the
main
flaw
in
thi
film
,
which
prevent
it
from
earn
four
star
,
is
that
it
seem
like
spielberg
and
franzoni
ca
n't
quit
handl
all
of
these
issu
at
the
same
time
,
so
instead
thei
settl
for
address
each
on
separ
and
simpli
edit
the
result
into
the
same
movi
.

thi
summer
's
contact
,
for
exampl
,
dealt
with
sever
issu
at
onc
,
but
each
of
them
wa
somehow
present
in
almost
everi
scene
and
,
most
importantli
,
all
of
them
were
resolv
at
onc
.

``
amistad
''
tri
to
pull
it
all
togeth
in
the
end
with
a
speech
from
adam
,
but
it
somehow
feel
a
littl
forc
,
and
in
ani
case
the
speech
itself
,
which
last
almost
fifteen
minut
,
wear
out
it
welcom
about
halfwai
through
.

perhap
the
best
wai
to
describ
it
is
thi
:
``
amistad
''
is
three
four
star
film
edit
into
on
.

almost
everi
individu
scene
work
,
but
the
final
product
is
lack
the
necessari
focu
and
coher
,
and
thu
is
less
than
the
sum
of
it
part
.

howev
,
i
ca
n't
honestli
sai
how
it
could
have
been
done
differ
,
and
in
ani
case
the
stori
come
through
with
enough
raw
emot
power
that
it
is
still
a
veri
good
film
,
and
thu
i
recommend
it
to
anyon
who
can
handl
the
disturb
imageri
.
