i
know
that
``
funnest
''
is
n't
a
word
.

``
fun
''
is
a
noun
,
and
therefor
can
not
be
conjug
like
an
adject
.

but
that
's
the
word
that
came
to
me
right
after
view
``
chicken
run
.
''

no
wonder
:
thi
is
the
kind
of
movi
that
reduc
you
to
childish
express
,
like
``
that
wa
the
funnest

the

part
of
what
made
the
``

film
brilliantli
entertain
wa
park
's
uncanni
abil
to
make
an
old
stori
seem
new
.

``

''
for
exampl
,
pull
out
a
lot
of
old
hitchcockian
suspens
trick
,
and
``
a
close

''
ow
a
great
deal
of
inspir
to
classic
detect
stori
.

but
in
the
hand
of
park
and
hi
team
,
the
stori
felt
fresh
and
inspir
,
and
not
the
least
bit
contriv
.

now
team
with
co-director
peter
lord
,
park
ha
creat
a
similar
creatur
in
``
chicken
run
.
''

the
plot
is
larg
lift
from
``
the
great
escap
''
-lrb-
watch
for
a
quick
refer
to
the
ball-bounc
scene
-rrb-
,
with
some

thing
is
,
the
film
doe
n't
feel
like
it
's
been
lift
from
somewher
els
;
``
chicken
run
''
feel
fresh
,
aliv
,
like
noth
els
ever
done
.

part
of
it
is
the
origin
idea
:
who
in
the
world
came
up
with
the
idea
to
make
a
prison-of-war
movi
star
chicken
?

park
and
lord
milk
the
incongru
for
all
it
's
worth
:
the
charact
treat
their
situat
as
if
it
were
dead
seriou
,
and
to
them
,
it
is
.

but
thei
're
*
chicken
*
,
so
it
's
funni
to
us
.

anoth
thing
that
help
``
chicken
run
''
-lrb-
and
most
of
park
's
film
-rrb-
succe
is
the
anim
'
subtl
wai
of
give
nod
to
the
veri
film
thei
're
crib
.

there
ar
refer
to
``
the
great
escap
,
''
obvious
,
and
``

''

the
chase
sequenc
insid
the
chicken
grinder
parodi
both
``
raider
of
the
lost
ark
''
and
``
indiana
jone
and
the
templ
of
doom
.
''

there
's
even
a
nod
to
``
the
blue
brother
,
''
if
you
can
believ
it
,
and
the
filmmak
even
get
in
a
littl
light-heart
rib
at
the
expens
of
their
star
voic
actor
,
take
a
coupl
of
veri
subtl
jab
at
mel
gibson
's
nation
and
film
histori
.

the
``
braveheart
''
refer
is
a
hoot
if
you
catch
it
.

when
you
consid
just
how
fine
a
line
resid
between
a
funni
parodi
and
a
redund
on
,
``
chicken
run
''
is
downright
brilliant
in
it
execut
.

consid
thi
:
sinc
juli
of
last
year
,
i
've
seen
dozen
upon
dozen
of
``
blair
witch
project
''
parodi
,
on

on

,
and
onlin
.

out
of
all
those
,
mayb
on
or
two
were

the
rest

why
?

becaus
onc
you
got
past
the
thought
that
``
thei
're
parodi
that
'
blair

'
movi
,
''
most
of
the
parodi
had
noth
to
offer
--
no
insight
,
no
origin
idea
,
no
greater
purpos
.

thei
were
onli
funni
if
you
had

;
otherwis
,
you
got
noth

convers
,
``

''
doe
n't
lean
on
it
parodi
--
the
film

ar
never
the
sole

of

scene
.

if
you
've
never
seen
``
indiana

,
''
the
chase
sequenc
is
still
fun
.

even
if
you
