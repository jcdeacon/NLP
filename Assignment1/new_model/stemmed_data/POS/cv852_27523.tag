be
the
self-proclaim
profession
film
critic
that
i
am
,
i
am
somewhat
embarrass
to
admit
that
i
had
not
seen
lawrenc
of
arabia
-lrb-
come
soon
to
dvd
-rrb-
until
onli
recent
.

after
all
,
it
's
consid
by
just
about
everyon
to
be
the
masterpiec
epic
of
director
david
lean
,
who
also
direct
film
such
as
bridg
on
the
river
kwai
,
and
doctor
zhivago
.

so
on
dai
,
a
friend
of
mine
loan
me
a
copi
of
the
video
and
i
sat
down
and
watch
it
.

i
wa
initi
skeptic
that
someth
made
almostyear
ago
would
be
abl
to
keep
my
attent
for
the
butt-numb1

2
hour
of
it
durat

but
now
i
fulli
understand
why
thi
ha
becom
the
film
that
other

--
the
winner
of

1963
for
best
pictur
,
director
,
edit
,
cinematographi
,
art
direct
,
music
,
and
sound
.

after
watch
the
film
again
,
i
am
convinc
that
it
is
simpli
on
of
the
finest
work
of
cinemat
geniu
to
ever
illumin

i
can
onli
imagin
what
it
must
have
been
like
to
sit
in
a
theater
in
1962
and
watch
thi
stori
unfold
befor
my
ey
.

everi

choreograph
as
a
portrait
--
a
live
tribut
to
a
great
land
.

david
lean
put
hi
reput
on
the
line
to
get
thi
film
complet
,
and
the
fact
that
it
wa
even
greenlit
in
the
first
place
sai
someth
about
the
ideolog
of
the
motion
pictur
industri
at
the
time
,
a
far
cry
from
it
pathet
,
uncr
exist
todai
.

after
watch
the
film
,
the
first
thing
that
came
to
my
mind
wa
,
``
i
've
got
to
do
a
remak
of
thi
film
!
''

but
then
i
thought
about
try
to
pitch
the
idea
to
a
modern-dai
movi
execut
:
``
okai
,
it
's
go
to
be
almost
four
hour
long
and
shot
over
three
month
on
locat
in
the
sahara
desert
.
''

we
ar
go
to
need
to
blow
up
a
full-size
train
becaus
comput-gener
effect
probabl
wont
do
it
justic
.

and
we
ar
not
go
to
us
ani
big
star
,
and
wo
n't
have
ani
femal
actor
sinc
there
's
no
love
stori
.
''
''

ye
,
my
friend
,
the
velvet
curtain
fell
on
the
golden-era
of
hollywood
a
long
time
ago
.

but
at
least
we
still
have
the
proof
to
show
all
would-be
produc
and
director
out
there
just
how
good
a
film
can
be
.
