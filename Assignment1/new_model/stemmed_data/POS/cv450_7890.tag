of

nearli
right

betray

corrupt
amount
into
a
forc
greater
than

and
toni
is
on
of
the
on
who
fall
victim
to
thi
forc

toni
get
to

no

basic
,
no

scarfac
,
although
incred
violent
,
is
on
of
the
best
crime
film
of
it
time
and
stand
out
as
anoth
great
perform
for
al
pacino
.

although
he
did
not
receiv
ani
recognit
from
the
academi
for
hi
perform
,
it
truli
is
a
veri
good
on
.

in
fact
,
hi
accent
and
facial
movement
alon
ar
enough
in
my
mind
to
win
at
least
a
nomin
-lrb-
although
he
did
get
a
golden
globe
nomin
-rrb-
.

anoth
element
that
stand
out
when
someon
mention
thi
film
is
the
profan
.

a
figur
tag
to
the
film
boast
that
the
word
``
fuck
''
and
it
's
us
ar
utter
206
time
throughout
the
film
,
which
is
appar
a
record
.

the
thing
is
,
the
vulgar
fit
rather
well
with
the
movi
.

as
odd
as
it
sound
,
it
's
true
.

in
the
end
,
scarfac
is
a
veri
power
film
that
hit
home
hard
.
