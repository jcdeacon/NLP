modern
societi
is
now
inund
with
more
sex
and
sexual
than
it
ever
ha
been
befor
,
from
teenag
sitcom
to
nc-17-rate
film
about
fetish
.

the
biggest
debat
of
the
subject
is
whether
or
not
it
affect
realiti
or
just
reflect
it
.

``
your
friend
and
neighbor
''
take
a
differ
approach
as
it
's
a
film
that
revolv
almost
entir
around
sex
and
how
can
be
us
for
both
pain
and
pleasur
even
within
a
small
circl
of
friend
.

on
of
the
most
import
aspect
of
the
film
that
most
be
note
and
analyz
befor
the
film
can
realli
be
dissect
as
a
whole
is
writer/director
neil
labut
's
basic
setup
and
some
of
the
uniqu
method
he
emploi
to
tell
the
stori
.

firstli
,
and
most
importantli
is
the
fact
the
script
tell
a
rather
complex
,
detail
stori
of
lust
,
betray
,
arrog
,
hypocrisi
,
greed
,
and
just
plain
stupid
between
six
differ
charact
-lrb-
three
men
,
three
women
-rrb-
,
without
hardli
ani
support
charact
,
-lrb-
a
few
have
a
line
or
two
-rrb-
,
mostli
extra
.

everyth
thei
do
will
somehow
affect
anoth
charact
and
ultim
come
full-circl
back
to
themselv
,
whether
it
be
posit
or
neg
.

but
to
just
state
thi
is
arbitrari
,
and
explain
and
critic
the
process
is
difficult
.

labut
's
abil
to
tell
hi
stori
through
a
few
charact
is
a
remark
feat
,
but
what
's
specif
impress
is
the
fact
the
charact
'
name
ar
never
reveal
until
the
end
credit
roll
.

for
the
sake
of
thi
review
,
i
will
describ
the
charact
and
refer
to
them
as
their
main
characterist
.

anoth
interest
accomplish
is
the
fact
everi
scene
take
place
insid
with
limit
focu
.

we
're
alwai
abl
to
tell
where
the
charact
ar
-lrb-
someon
's
home
,
the
gym
,
a
restaur
,
hotel
room
,
etc.
-rrb-
,
but
what
the
citi
thei
live
in
,
what
year
it
is
,
what
the
societi
is
like
,
etc.
is
rel
unknown
.

the
film
is
a
complet
charact
studi
with
the
tight
,
intens
drama
of
the
theater
.

no
on
plot
domin
the
stori
,
which
make
the
first
act
a
bit
tediou
for
it
lack
of
background
.

we
're
simpli
drop
in
on
the
charact
'
live
and
ar
expect
to
figur
out
the
rest
.

the
charact
ar
a
group
of
middl-class
white
peopl
who
ar
all
success
at
what
thei
do
,
but
thei
're
onli
concern
right
now
seem
to
be
their
sex
live
.

first
there
's
barri
-lrb-
eckhart
-rrb-
and
mari
-lrb-
brenneman
-rrb-
,
a
marri
coupl
who
ar
go
through
a
dry
spell
not
unlik
mani
other
coupl
in
other
situat
who
do
n't
know
what
thei
're
problem
is
.

barri
is
kind
of
a
dorki
businessman
who
love
hi
wife
,
and
the
sex
thei
have
,
but
doe
n't
have
a
lot
of
ambit-he
just
follow
everyon
els
.

mari
is
a
writer
of
some
sort
,
but
lack
aggress
and
emot
like
her
husband
and
is
the
meek
charact
,
but
iron
,
doe
n't
hesit
to
commit
adulteri
just
to
feel
someth
.

labut
's
script
doe
a
good
job
in
character
mari
and
barri
as
individu
,
but
is
veri
light
on
chemistri
and
connect
between
the
two
.

obvious
,
thi
is
the
theme
,
which
is
enhanc
by
the
actor
'
good
perform
,
but
at
the
same
time
seem
just
a
bit
hollow
.

anoth
coupl
is
jerri
-lrb-
stiller
-rrb-
and
terri
-lrb-
keener
-rrb-
who
live
togeth
and
seem
to
have
been
involv
with
each
other
for
a
long
time
,
yet
thei
constantli
argu
over
anyth
and
everyth
.

their
sex
life
is
also
fraught
with
problem
and
for
some
reason
thei
continu
to
do
it
throughout
their
infidelit
relationship
.

if
onli
on
aspect
of
the
film
could
us
improv
,
it
would
be
thi
area
.

it
's
natur
for
a
marri
coupl
to
becom
bore
with
each
other
,
but
why
would
two
peopl
who
can
bare
stand
each
other
continu
to
have
sex
and
live
togeth
?

what
did
thei
ever
see
in
the
other
person
to
begin
with
?

labut
never
realli
answer
,
but
sinc
the
film
is
more
concern
with
the
payoff
than
the
process
,
it
still
make
for
good
drama
,
tension
,
and
manip
ulat
so
intric
and
deceit
it
's
fascin
.

two
other
charact
act
as
catalyst
,
cari
-lrb-
jason
patric
-rrb-
and
cheri
-lrb-
natassja
kinski
-rrb-
.

cari
is
an
arrog
,
hostil
sex-maniac
who
defin
the
word
``
bastard
.
''

somehow
he
is
abl
to
bend
women
to
hi
will
,
either
through
charm
or
just
attitud
,
into
get
hi
wai
.

he
's
the
kind
of
gui
everyon
should
stai
awai
from
as
we
realiz
he
's
secretli
pervert
,
but
somehow
barri
find
comfort
in
hi
compani
,
although
jerri
is
alwai
nervou
around
him
.

patric
give
an
outstand
perform
,
so
much
so
that
we
want
to
know
more
about
him
despit
how
intimid
and
unlik
he
is
.

cheri
is
a
charact
labut
us
as
a
catalyst
to
see
how
the
other
charact
react
to
her
.

she
work
in
an
art
museum
and
at
some
point
throughout
the
film
,
each
charact
will
engag
her
in
almost
the
exact
same
convers
and
her
reaction
is
alwai
differ
,
from
becom
involv
in
a
relationship
with
on
,
to
brush
it
off
as
small
talk
with
anoth
,
to
be
outright
appal
by
yet
anoth
.

she
's
a
sweet
woman
,
perhap
the
most
normal
of
ani
of
the
charact
,
and
although
her
symbol
is
obviou
,
her
role
as
the
outsid
is
the
most
relat
.

i
will
not
reveal
who
cheat
on
who
and
how
each
charact
is
specif
affect
by
the
other
'
action
,
as
that
's
the
hook
of
the
film
.

the
first
two
act
begin
to
set
up
the
charact
and
each
's
scenario
,
but
it
's
often
difficult
to
tell
what
thei
will
do
about
it
and
with
whom
.

the
result
is
sometim
surpris
,
other
time
predict
,
but
the
actual
cours
of
action
is
alwai
fascin
.

for
a
while
everyon
ha
their
fun
,
but
ultim
each
charact
's
guilt
,
attitud
,
or
ignor
will
disserv
them
.

on
of
the
most
import
thing
to
note
is
how
realist
the
stori
is
suppos
to
be
.

sinc
the
charact
onli
interact
with
each
other
there
is
n't
much
pop
cultur
refer
,
as
almost
everyth
ha
a
deeper
philosophi
behind
it
.

ar
we
to
assum
that
these
peopl
ar
,
as
the
titl
state
,
our
friend
and
neighbor
?

i
do
n't
know
of
anyon
go
through
the
same
situat
as
these
peopl
.

often
time
the
film
is
not
unlik
a
network
melodrama
,
other
time
situat
ar
like
those
not
seen
outsid
a
porno
movi
.

but
what
thi
film
doe
have
that
the
other
do
n't
is
repercuss
in
the
end
.

although
the
film
creat
it
own
realiti
,
it
goe
to
show
that
even
the
immor
ar
n't
immort
.

in
what
wai
``
your
friend
and
neighbor
''
is
suppos
to
work
is
open
to
interpret
.

it
definit
ha
a
lot
to
sai
about
the
price
that
come
with
infidel
,
but
it
could
have
been
even
better
had
it
expand
on
that
theme
more
specif
.

still
,
it
's
an
accomplish
in
film-make
becaus
it
ha
put
a
timeless
theme
into
a
modern
perspect
.
